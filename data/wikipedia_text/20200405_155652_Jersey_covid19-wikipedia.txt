Timeline[edit]On 10 March, the first case was confirmed. The infected person had travelled from Italy.[9]On 11 March a second case was confirmed.[10]On 20 March there were 10 cases confirmed in Jersey, two of which were believed to have been contracted within the island.[11][12]On 25 March a person in their 80's died. They had long-term health conditions and had been receiving palliative care before contracting COVID-19.[13]On 29 March a second person died. They were in their 70's and had long-term health conditions before contracting the virus.[14]On 30 March, the Chief Minister stated that there were ten patients with COVID-19 being treated at the hospital.[15]On 2 April, nine patients were being treated in hospital.On 4 April, a third death was announced - a patient in their late 60s who had underlying health conditions,[16] and the total number of cases confirmed stood at 126.[2]Response by the Government of Jersey[edit]Overview of response[edit]On 12 March, the advice from Senator John Fondré, Chief Minister of Jersey was to maintain a semblance of normal life, including continuing to go on holidays off-island,[17] but by 14 March his advice changed, requesting over-65s to start social distancing,[18] and on 20 March he extended this advice to islanders of all ages.[19] Islanders must avoid non-essential travel.[20][21]
From 20 March all travellers arriving on the island, other than essential workers, must self-isolate for 14 days.[21] From midnight on 26 March those aged over 65 and people with certain underlying medical conditions must self-isolate.[22] On 28 March, islanders were told that if one or more people in a household develop COVID-19 symptoms then all the other members of the household must also self-isolate for 14 days.[23]

They are due to arrive in batches with the first batch expected in April.[27] They intend to test all households in order to enable a phased 'managed exit from the stay home restrictions'.[32] Islanders will be asked to attend mobile testing centres around the island.[27]
