A student from Iran tested positive on 27 February and was admitted to a hospital in Minsk.[3][2] The individual arrived in Belarus via a flight from Baku, Azerbaijan, on 22 February.[3][4]
As of 3 March, there were 4 confirmed cases in Belarus.[5]
On 4 March, the Ministry of Health of Belarus confirmed 6 new cases of the disease: 4 cases in Minsk, 2 cases in Vitebsk.[6]
On 13 March, 27 cases were confirmed in Grodno, Gomel, Minsk, Vitebsk, and Minsk Region, including 5 students from the Faculty of International Relations of Belarusian State University.[7] Three patients were discharged from hospitals.[8][9]
On 16 March, the health ministry stated that the number of confirmed cases reached 36.[10] No new laboratory confirmed cases were reported on 17 March.[11]
As of 18 March, a total of 51 confirmed cases have been registered, including 5 recoveries and 37 cases of asymptomatic infection course.[12][13]

As of 21 March, a total of 76 confirmed cases have been reported.[16]
As of 23 March, 81 confirmed cases have been reported, including 22 recoveries. According to the official data, more than 21,000 COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Belarus since 23 January.[17][18]
As of 25 March, a total of 86 confirmed cases have been reported, including 29 recoveries.[19]

As of 30 March, a total of 152 confirmed cases have been reported, including 47 recoveries. More than 30,000 COVID-19 tests have been conducted to date since 23 January.[21]
On 31 March, an officially unconfirmed death of a test-positive 75 years old patient in Vitebsk was reported by the media. Reportedly, the patient suffered from a chronic pulmonary decease.[22][23][24] Later that day, the first case of death due to COVID-19 was confirmed by the Ministry of Health of Belarus.[25]
On 1 April, the second death of elderly COVID-19 patient with chronic deceases was reported by the Ministry of Health. According to the report, as of 1 April 2020, there were 163 COVID-19 cases registered in Belarus, including 2 deaths and at least 47 recoveries.[26] However, the ambiguity of the latest government reports has led to unofficial counting attempts, based on the official data, according to which the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Belarus could be as high as 217.[27] On that same day, the first COVID-19 case in Brest Region was reported by the officials.[28]
On 2 April, the Ministry of Health of Belarus reported a total of 304 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 254 active cases, 46 recoveries and 4 deaths. According to the report, 11 patents require assisted ventilation and  9,299 people remain under medical observation as first- and second-level contacts.[29]
On 3 April, during a briefing of Ministry of Health officials for the press, a total of 351 confirmed cases were reported, including 190 in Minsk, 89 in Vitebsk Region, 50 in Minsk Region, 13 in Gomel Region, 6 in Grodno Region, 2 in Mogilev Region and 1 in Brest Region. According to the officials, the majority of the COVID-19 patients are in 25 to 64 years old range.[30]
On 4 April, a total of 440 confirmed cases have been reported, including 41 recovery and 5 deaths. According to the media, the declining number of recoveries is due to changes in the counting methodology used by the officials: prior to 30 March, both discharged and "preparing to be discharged" patients were reported as recovered; after the 30 March, only the discharged patients are counted as recovered.[31]
Government response[edit]On 16 March 2020, president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, dismissed the threat of coronavirus and encouraged working in fields and driving tractors as a way of overcoming the pandemic: "You just have to work, especially now, in a village [...] there, the tractor will heal everyone. The fields heal everyone".[32] In his further comments on the pandemic, the Belarussian leader referred to it as "psychosis" and, on 28 March, played a game of hockey, later stating in an interview "it is better to die on our feet, than live on your knees [...] sport, especially on ice, is better than any antiviral medication, it is the real thing".[33][34] Prior to that, in an official meeting, Lukashenko proposed "poisoning" the coronavirus with vodka, as well as attending banyas as the best cure for the disease.[35]
On 25 March 2020, a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine requirement was instituted for persons entering Belarus from countries affected by the pandemic, with the exception of diplomats and their families, air crews and persons transiting Belarus on return to their home countries.[36]
As of 30 March, Belarus has not initiated a nation-wide quarantine effort.[21] That, as well as the gradual decrease in transparency of the official reports on the pandemic, led to criticism from the press and population, emphasizing absence of the up-to-date information about the territories affected by the virus, decreased update frequency and increased ambiguity of the official reports, as well as restraint of the non-governmental media from the government sessions on the epidemiological situation in the country.[37]
On 4 April, a one-week extension of spring vacation for schools was announced by the Ministry of Education of Belarus.[38]
Economic impact[edit]On 30 March 2020, Belarus and IMF started negotiations on the $900 million loan intended to compensate the economic losses from the coronavirus pandemic.[39]
