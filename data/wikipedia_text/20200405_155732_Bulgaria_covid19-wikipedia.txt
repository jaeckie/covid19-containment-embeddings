MG Prof. Dr. Mutafchiyski is the Director of the Military Medical Academy and the most senior medical officer of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. The MMA combines the military medical services of the country in their entirety with several hospitals in the capital Sofia and around the country. At the same time it is one of the country's leading medical institutions and possesses large medical treatment capacity and know-how. The Staff fulfills a direct operational role in the management of the crisis and its decisions are implemented through executive orders of Bulgaria's Prime Minister and the country's Minister of Health.
On 23 March a separate Medical Council for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic was appointed by the Prime Minister. The Council is chaired by Professor Kosta Kostov, a leading pulmonary disease expert. The Council's mission is to provide the government with complementary analysis and action proposals and the general public with professional guidance and information. Unlike the National Crisis-management Staff, which is a formal national institution with executive power and tasks, the Council has mostly a knowledge-based advisory role.[3]
Timeline[edit]8 March[edit]On 8 March 2020 Bulgaria confirmed its first two cases, a 27-year-old man from Pleven and a 75-year-old woman from Gabrovo. Neither of the two reported having traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals.[4] Two other samples in Pleven and Gabrovo were found positive on 8 March.[5] Patient zero remains unknown.[6]
On the same day, the hospital in Gabrovo requested additional personnel from other hospitals in the country, as it only had three communicable diseases specialists. All of its internal medicine specialists have been quarantined after one of the four initial cases was confirmed to be a nurse at the hospital.[7] The government issued a nationwide ban on closed-door public events.[8] The origin of the outbreak remains unknown, and the Ministry of Interior is tracking down all individuals who have been in contact with the patients.[9] As of 8 March, 254 suspected cases were under quarantine across the country.[10]
10 March[edit]Two additional cases were confirmed in Sofia on 10 March 2020: a 74-year-old man and his 66-year-old wife. Both have arrived from Lom two weeks prior to admission.[11][12] The woman died on the next day, becoming the first COVID-19 victim in the country.[13]
11 March[edit]A suspected case of a 33-year-old man was reported by the Saint George Hospital in Plovdiv on 11 March.[14] The same day, a 40-year-old woman in Varna showed COVID-19 symptoms on CT scan, although regional health authorities have not yet confirmed the case.[15]
12 March[edit]By 12 March, the number of cases had increased to 23, most of them in Sofia. Many of these had been in contact with the elderly couple admitted to the Pirogov Hospital on 10 March.
13 March[edit]On 13 March, after 16 reported cases in one day, Bulgaria declared a state of emergency for one month until 13 April. Schools, shopping centres, cinemas, restaurants, and other places of business were closed. All sports events were suspended. Only supermarkets, food markets, pharmacies, banks and gas stations remain open.[16] Additionally, all arrivals from Italy, Spain, Iran, South Korea and China were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine.[17] There were 13 breaches of quarantine; patients involved were returned to treatment facilities and warned of repercussions, including fines and prison sentences.[18]
14 March[edit]On 14 March, a second death and a third case in Pleven were reported. The second victim of the virus was the 74-year old husband of the first victim.[19]
15 March[edit]The number of confirmed cases in Bulgaria rose to 51 on 15 March. A total of 83 tests were done at the Military Medical Academy, of which six were positive, and 51 were processed at the National Reference Laboratory, of which two were positive. In Varna, one test out of 12 samples proved positive.
16 March[edit]The Ministry of Health announced that citizens from a number of countries would be prohibited from entering Bulgaria starting 00:00 on 18 March. These are China, Iran, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Spain, Italy, South Korea, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Additionally, sanitary control units will be established on some border crossings with Serbia, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania.[20] The number of total cases rose to 62, including two British citizens vacationing in Bansko.
17 March[edit]81 cases were reported, several linked to an outbreak in Bansko. None of the patients were in critical condition.[21]
18 March[edit]The total number of cases increased to 94 by 18 March, with new cases appearing in Smolyan, Veliko Tarnovo and Pernik among recent arrivals from outside the country. The previous day, Bansko became the first town in the country to be put under quarantine.[22][23]
19 March[edit]On 19 March the cases rose to 105 and an 80-year-old woman, who recently had a stroke, died from COVID-19 on the same day, making her the third victim from the disease in Bulgaria. Elsewhere, a 78-year-old Bulgarian citizen died from COVID-19 while visiting family in Pittsburgh,  PA. The woman, a choir conductor in Sofia, was uninsured and refused to seek medical attention.[24]
20 March[edit]The total number of cases increased to 127 and the first recovery occurred.
21 March[edit]The number of cases increased to 142 by noon, and three patients had recovered. Two cities, Dobrich and Shumen, confirmed their first cases, the latter related to the Bansko cluster. There are 84 male and 58 female patients, the youngest being 4 years old, and the oldest 81 years old. More than 5,000 tests had been carried out, and an additional 10,000 tests would be made available at short notice.[25]
24 March[edit]The cases increased to 218 and the first case in Stara Zagora province was confirmed. A man from the town of Kazanlak was admitted in the Infectious unit in the hospital in Stara Zagora. He is believed to be 60 years old and returned from France on the 14th of March.[26]

The new cases included 19 in Sofia, 5 in Blagoevgrad, 4 in Burgas, 3 in Varna, 2 each in Kardzhali, Plovdiv and Shumen, and 1 in Smolyan. Four new deaths were also reported, with two occurring in Blagoevgrad and one each in Kyustendil and Sofia.[27] The cases in Blagoevgrad, a mother and her daughter, were initially refused admission to the local hospital despite visible symptoms and had to request testing at a private lab; by the time the results came out as positive, the patients' condition had deteriorated significantly. They were eventually admitted and sent to intensive care, but both died shortly after.[28]
29 March[edit]A total of 15 new cases were reported, with 8 in Sofia, 3 in Plovdiv, and one each in Kardzhali, Sliven, Smolyan and Varna. Three new recoveries were also announced, while the number of deaths rose to 8 after a 51-year-old woman died in the Blagoevgrad hospital, one day after her mother had succumbed to the virus. The Ministry of Health announced that 125 out of 324 active cases remain hospitalized, with 13 of those in serious condition. The total number of tests performed exceeded 7,000, with 276 done on 29 March alone.[29]

Statistics[edit]Cases[edit]

Deaths[edit]Recoveries[edit]Response[edit]At the time of the announcement, schools had already been closed until March 11 due to an influenza B epidemic.[51] A massive increase in influenza B cases prompted suspensions of routine medical examinations, and a recommendation by the government for suspension of lectures at universities.[52] According to the latest Ministry of Health data, there were 2063 intensive care and 740 infectious disease hospital beds in the country, with a total of 1605 ventilators across the health system.[53] However, Chief Health Inspector Angel Kunchev stated on 5 March that there is a shortage of medical personnel.[54]
Following the announcement of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, the Bulgarian government immediately banned the exports of protective equipment and placed orders for masks and protective suits to local manufacturers. In addition, 30,000 masks and 50,000 protective suits will be delivered by Turkey.[55] Some 111,000 suits and masks are required every month and the government plans to distribute them to health workers, social assistants, law enforcement personnel and border guards.[56] Sofia Municipality has increased disinfections to four times daily at public institutions and in public transport.[57] Personnel in all hospitals was reportedly being screened for the disease,[58] but in April a nurse in Vidin reported that she was refused a test after caring for a positive patient, as the hospital in the city had no testing kits.[59]
By mid-March, large-scale imports of protective equipment from Vietnam, China and India had begun. Many volunteers were also signing up to join the handling of the crisis, including Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy cadets.[60]
On 30 March, the Minister of Health Kiril Ananiev decreed wearing masks in public mandatory, both outdoors and indoors, despite nationwide protective equipment shortages and soaring prices.[61][62][63] The policy seemed to contradict Ananiev's earlier statement from 9 March that producing the needed gear "will take months".[64] Under article 209a of the Health Law, which was passed on 13 March and does not discriminate between offenses, failing to wear a mask in public would result in a fine of BGN 5,000 (EUR 2,555).[65] On 31 March Ananiev rescinded the decree, citing "a lack of public consensus" on the measure.[66]
Nearly BGN 14,000,000 (EUR 7,160,000) had been donated by 3 April, with 48% coming from private companies, 26% from public campaigns, 19% from individual donors and 7% from foundations.[37]
Testing[edit]As of 24 March, there are 5 laboratories testing for COVID-19 in the country with a capacity of 300 tests per day. The total number of tests done by March 26 was 6,454, with 264 confirmed cases and a rate of infection around 4.1%.[67]
On 27 March, the Ministry of Health announced that the country now has the capacity to process between 1,000 and 1,200 tests per day, at an estimated cost of BGN 930,000 (EUR 475,000) per month. Two additional methods of testing would be introduced at later stages of the pandemic - fluorescence immunochromatographic tests (up to 20,000 per day) and the so-called 'quick' tests (up to 40,000 per day). Major General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski called all three types "equally important", as the PCR ones provided reliable data, while the fluorescence tests could speed up the process before quick ones are applied to establish how many people have acquired immunity.[68] However, Mutafchiyski later added that rapid tests are considered "unreliable" and therefore mass screening would be "meaningless".[69]
Conversely, Prof. Radka Argirova, chairman of the National Expert Board in Virology at the Bulgarian Doctors' Union, urged increased rapid testing in order to discover asymptomatic cases, avoiding the chance of a future second peak and terminating the epidemic progression.[70]
On 5 April, the Ministry of Health announced a total of 15,599 tests had been performed to date in eight laboratories across the country.[39]
Medication[edit]After testing positive for COVID-19, business magnate Kiril Domuschiev announced that his company will procure chloroquine from foreign sources and donate it to the national coronavirus task force. Chloroquine, a quinine drug, has shown positive effects on COVID-19 patients in China and France. The Bulgarian government is looking into import opportunities from China and domestic production by local pharmaceutical companies.[71] Exports of all quinine-based drugs were prohibited until further notice, and 35,000 doses of quinine-based Analgin for export have been diverted for domestic consumption. Another 250,000 doses of the drug can reportedly be produced on a short notice by local pharmaceutical companies.[72] On 3 April, the government negotiated the delivery of 171,429 packs of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and 30,000 packs of azithromycin from the China National Pharmaceutical Group.[73]
Bulgarian biotechnology company Micar21 has been developing a general coronavirus vaccine in the past four years, and announced that it will begin clinical trials of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on this research in mid-2020.[74] The company announced that with government support in funding and shorter clinical trial protocols, the drug could be synthesised in two months.[75]
Criticism[edit]Georgi Todorov, a Bulgarian doctor with experience in viral breakouts in Ghana, criticised the handling of the COVID-19 threat. In particular, Todorov stated that Bulgaria's health administration is so rife with nepotism that it cannot come up with any coherent response; as a result, infectious disease specialists were not taken into account when formulating response policies, and no specific locations were designated for potential COVID-19 cases. Todorov further assumed that infected individuals may have not been identified because of improper application of testing procedures.[76]
According to Prof. Milan Milanov, former manager of Pirogov Hospital, the government's response was "catastrophically delayed", although he added that there's no room for panic as COVID-19 treatment was "the same as with influenza".[77]
Impact[edit]Bulgaria recorded 31,643 newly registered unemployed for the period between 13 March to 1 April. From these, 17,793 claimants stated that job losses were a direct consequence of the pandemic, and 12,661 registered in the week 23-27 March alone, compared to 4,561 for the same period in 2019.[78] A survey conducted by the Bulgarian Industrial Association showed only 8% of the companies were willing to use the government stimulus package, which quickly became colloquially known as 'the 60:40 measure'.[79] The proposal envisions the government paying 60% of the impacted businesses' employee wages for up to three months, as long as the companies refrain from lay-offs.[80]
