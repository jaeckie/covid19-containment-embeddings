Confirmation that the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic had spread to Ireland came on 29 February 2020.[5] Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer for the Irish Department of Health, announced its arrival.[5] By 20 March, around three weeks later, it was present in all 26 counties.[6][7]
The pandemic's arrival affected many aspects of society, initially including the cancellation of St Patrick's Day parades and all festivals.[8][9][10][11] Taoiseach Leo Varadkar broke from a trip to Washington, D.C.—where he was meeting with President of the United States Donald Trump—to announce the closure of all schools, colleges, childcare and other public facilities until at least 29 March 2020.[12] These public health measures were subsequently expanded and extended until at least 19 April 2020.[13]
President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins signed into law an emergency bill—which had earlier passed through Dáil and Seanad Éireann—giving the state the power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes in order to restrict the pandemic.[14]
As of 4 April, there have been 4,604 confirmed cases and 137 deaths.[15]

On 3 March, a second case was confirmed of a female in the east of the country who had been to Northern Italy.[21] She had had no contact with the first case.
On 4 March, four more cases were confirmed, two females and two males in the west of the country who travelled from northern Italy, bringing the total to six.[22]
On 5 March, seven more cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 13.[23] Four of the cases were related to travel from Northern Italy—four males from the east of the country—one of these four cases was connected to Trinity College Dublin.[24] Two of the seven cases were associated with close contact with a confirmed case—two females in the west of the country. One of the seven cases was a male in the south of the country who had no history of travel abroad.[25]
On 6 March, it was reported that more than 60 staff at Cork University Hospital would have to self-isolate following a case of community transmission of COVID-19 at the hospital.[26] The same day brought confirmation of five more cases, bringing the total in the country at that time to 18.[27]
On 7 March, one more case was confirmed bringing the total to 19.[28] On 8 March, two more cases were confirmed bringing the total to 21.[29] On 9 March, three more cases were confirmed bringing the total to 24.[30] On 10 March, ten more cases were confirmed bringing the total to 34.[31]
On 11 March, an elderly patient in Naas General Hospital in County Kildare (south-west of the country's capital city, Dublin) became Ireland's first fatality from the virus; nine new cases were announced.[32] This brought confirmed cases to 43. Cork University Hospital discharged a patient who had been admitted for coronavirus disease after they made a full recovery.[33]
Delay Phase: 12–27 March[edit]On 12 March, 27 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total cases in the country to 70.[34] In response to the increase of cases, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities until 29 March.[12] The announcement, which came one day after the World Health Organization formally declared that the outbreak was pandemic, also marked Ireland's movement from the Containment Phase in its strategy to combat the spread of the virus (a strategy which the Department of the Taoiseach had reaffirmed just three days earlier) towards the Delay Phase.[35][36]
On 13 March, 20 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total cases in the country to 90.[37] On 14 March, 39 new cases were confirmed and another death announced of a man in the East of the country with underlying medical conditions. This brought the total cases to 129, with 2 deaths in total.[38]
On 15 March, 40 new cases were confirmed. The total number of cases stood at 169 with 2 deaths.[39] Four patients were discharged from University Hospital Limerick.[40] The Government ordered bars and public houses to close and advised against house parties.[41]
On 16 March, 54 new cases were confirmed. The total number of cases stood at 223 with 2 deaths.[42] On 17 March, 69 new cases were confirmed, bringing total cases in the country to 292 with 2 deaths[43]
On 18 March, 74 new cases were confirmed, bringing total cases in the country to 366 with 2 deaths.[44]
More detailed information about hospital statistics, age range affected, how COVID-19 was spreading, healthcare workers and cases by county was published by the National Public Health Emergency Team starting on this day. It showed that the virus was present in 23 of the 26 counties, with Laois, Leitrim and Monaghan the only three yet to record a case.[45]
On 19 March, 191 new cases were confirmed, bringing total to 557. 1 new death was recorded, bringing the total to 3 deaths.[46][47] The woman died in an isolation ward in St Vincent's Hospital.[48][49] Her daughter later spoke to the media and urged the public to protect themselves from the virus.[50][51][52]
On 20 March, 126 new cases were reported, bringing the total to 683. It was also confirmed that the virus had since infected Laois and Leitrim, leaving Monaghan as the last of the 26 counties.[53] On 21 March, 102 new cases were reported, bringing the total to 785.[54]
On 22 March, 121 new cases were announced, bringing the total to 906. A fourth death was also announced, bringing the total number of deaths to 4.[55] The man, who died at the Mater Hospital, was musical director of a choir in Dublin and former Head of Vocal Studies at the Royal Irish Academy of Music.[56][57]
On 23 March, a further 219 cases and 2 more deaths were announced, bringing the totals to 1,125 cases and 6 deaths.[58] Of those then diagnosed, 208 were health care workers.[59] On 24 March, a further 204 cases and one more death were announced, bringing the total number of cases to 1,329 and 7 deaths.[60] On 25 March, 235 cases were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,564. Two deaths also occurred, bringing the total number of deaths to 9.[61] On 26 March, 255 cases and 10 deaths were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,819, and the total number of deaths to 19, more than double the previous day's total.[62] At this point, deaths began to accelerate rapidly.
Stay at Home phase: 27 March–present[edit]On 27 March, 302 new cases as well as 3 new deaths brought the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,121 and 22, respectively.[63] Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a series of measures which he summed up as: "Stay at Home" (subject to certain exemptions).[64] Merrion Street described it as "a more intensive phase in our response to COVID-19".[65] The measures, which coincided with an escalating death toll, were also a response to increased reliance on intensive care units (ICUs) to treat critically-ill patients, and an attempt to lower this number before capacity was reached.[66]
On 28 March, 294 new cases, as well as 14 new deaths, brought the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,415 and 36, respectively.[67]
On 29 March, 200 cases and 10 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,615 and 46, respectively.[68]
On 30 March, 295 cases and 8 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,910 and 54, respectively.[69]
On 31 March, 325 cases and 17 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 3,235 and 71, respectively.[70]
On 1 April, an additional 212 cases and 14 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 3,447, and the total number of deaths to 85.[71] It was also announced that Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan, who displayed signs of illness during the previous evening's news conference, had entered hospital for non-COVID reasons; Ronan Glynn (Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Head of the Department of Health's Health Protection Unit) took charge.[72]
On 2 April, a further 402 cases and 13 deaths were announced, bringing the totals to 3,849 cases and 98 deaths.[73]
On 3 April, a further 424 cases and 22 deaths were reported, bringing the totals to 4,273 cases and 120 deaths.[74] One patient was discharged from Sligo University Hospital after being hospitalized for 10 days.[75]
Testing[edit]Many Gaelic games stadiums were repurposed as drive-through COVID-19 testing centres. These included Croke Park in Dublin;[76] Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork;[77] Nowlan Park in Kilkenny;[78] Gaelic Grounds in Limerick;[79] MacHale Park in Castlebar;[80][81] Breffni Park in Cavan;[82] O'Donnell Park in Letterkenny.[83]
Other drive-through testing centres included St Vincent's in Athlone;[84] Castlebar Leisure Complex in County Mayo;[85] the disused St Conal's Hospital in Letterkenny;[86] St Loman's Hospital in Mullingar;[87] the Clarion Road in Sligo;[88] Tallaght Stadium (the home ground of Shamrock Rovers Football Club) in Tallaght;[89][90][91] a prefabricated HSE-owned building in Waterford near Cherrymount in Ballytruckle, which had been used by St Martin's Special School.[92]
The military response to the pandemic, which included provision of naval vessels to support onshore testing in Irish cities, was known as Operation Fortitude and involved such ships as LÉ Samuel Beckett, LÉ George Bernard Shaw and LÉ Niamh (Dublin), LÉ Eithne (Cork) and LÉ William Butler Yeats (Galway).[93][94][95][96][97][98]
As of 9 March 2020, 1,784 people had been tested.[99]
As of 17 March, 6,636 people had been tested.[100]
As of 21 March, over 10,000 people had been tested.[101]
As of 23 March, 17,992 tests had been carried out.[102]
As of 23 March, around 40,000 people were waiting to be tested and the average wait time was 4 to 5 days. Minister for Health Simon Harris said that priority testing of only healthcare workers might have to be implemented.[103]
On 25 March—to prioritise testing of healthcare workers—the threshold for requesting a COVID-19 test was narrowed. From then a person requesting a COVID-19 test had to: (i) be a healthcare worker; OR (ii) present with a fever and at least one other COVID-19 symptom.[61]
As of 30 March, 30,213 tests had been carried out.[104]
Cases[edit]


Impact[edit]Economy[edit]On 10 March—following the Italian government's decision to lockdown the country in a bid to decelerate the rapid spread of the virus—Ryanair announced it would suspend all flights to, from and within Italy until 8 April, while Aer Lingus did likewise—but with 3 April as its intended end date.[122]
Initially, pubs and bars—alongside restaurants and cinemas—were permitted to remain open if they respected the social distancing measures introduced on 12 March. However, difficulties in maintaining this became clear over the weekend before Saint Patrick's Day. On 14 March, Minster for Health Simon Harris announced on Twitter: "Not far from here, nurses & doctors are working to prepare for the impact of a global pandemic. Everyone is working 24/7. This is an insult to their efforts", alongside one video circulating of a Temple Bar pub filled with people singing an extract from "Sweet Caroline", i.e. "Hands, touching hands... Reaching out, touching me, touching you".[123][124] Harris acted swiftly, and—by the following morning—the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association and the Irish government issued a joint call for all bars and pubs to close from midnight until—at minimum—29 March. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, a qualified medical doctor, advised on Twitter: "People who have been out this weekend should avoid physical contact with seniors or people with chronic diseases. You could make them very, very sick". Varadkar also used Twitter to reiterate his stance against mass gatherings of more than 100 people and stated his intention to "seek enforcement powers from Dáil/Seanad" if necessary, so as to compel delinquent pubs and bars to shut. The decision did not affect restaurants and cinemas—provided they maintained social distancing—though the Chief Executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Adrian Cummins, called for a shutdown of the country's restaurant industry.[125][126][127] Pubs continued to open though. Niall Collins stated that pubs in Limerick were opening after the officla shutdown had come into effect.[128]
Restaurants, however, decided to shut their doors on their own initiative. On 22 March, it was announced that all McDonald's outlets in Ireland and the United Kingdom would be closed from 7pm on 23 March.[129][130] The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) outlined the impact this would have on Irish beef farmers, as McDonald's is their biggest customer, dealing with 18,000 Irish farms and using Irish beef in one fifth of its burgers across Europe.[131] The day after the McDonald's announcement, coffeehouse chain Costa Coffee and restaurant franchise Subway both announced they would shut their Irish outlets, as did doughnut company Krispy Kreme do regarding its one Irish outlet in Dublin. The Irish fast food restaurant chain Supermac's announced the same day as the Costa and Subway closures that it would shut all its restaurants by the evening of 26 March; it intended the delay to allow emergency services using its facilities time to plan where they would eat, but did say it would shut its seating areas that night.[132]
Major departments stores shut, including McElhinney's on Sunday 13 March,[133] while Brown Thomas and Arnotts closed on the evening of 18 March.[134] The clothing retailer Penneys (which trades abroad as Primark) followed suit the same evening.[135][136]
By mid-March, nearly 3% of the population—140,000 people (including 70,000 restaurant staff, 50,000 pub and bar staff and about 20,000 créche and childcare workers)—had lost their jobs due to restrictions brought in to delay the virus's spread.[137] The numbers of people in normally busy Dublin areas such as Grafton Street dropped by percentages in the sixties, seventies and eighties.[138][139]
On 16 March, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection Regina Doherty announced a Pandemic Unemployment Payment, available for six weeks.[140] On 19 March, Doherty announced that all welfare would be distributed each fortnight instead of the traditional weekly, so as to limit the number of people gathering in post offices.[141]
On 18 March, banks—together with Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe—announced a range of measures, including providing working capital, payment breaks and deferred court proceedings.[142]
Education[edit]Initially, some schools around the country were closed and pupils were instructed to self-isolate.[143][144] Trinity College Dublin cancelled lectures and moved to online delivery.[145]
On 12 March, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar—speaking from Washington, D.C. where he was meeting U.S. President Donald Trump—announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities across Ireland until at least 29 March.[12]
On 19 March, Minister for Education Joe McHugh announced the cancellation of Leaving and Junior Cert oral and practical exams, with all students given top marks.[146]
On 21 March, State broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) announced that it would begin showing "school" live on television.[147] The broadcasts began on Monday 30 March, aimed at children attending 1st–6th class of primary school (i.e. roughly 6–12 years of age).[148]
On 24 March, Minister for Education Joe McHugh confirmed that schools would not be reopening on 30 March as had been the official deadline until then.[149][150]
On 2 April, the Department of Education deferred the introduction of its "School Inclusion Model" for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) in schools that had been scheduled for September 2020, citing cancellations of meetings due to COVID-19 and the absence of therapists called to assist the Health Service Executive (HSE) in its battle against the pandemic.[151] Also on 2 April, RTÉ announced it would—on weekend mornings—televise those plays of William Shakespeare on the Junior and Leaving Certificate syllabi, to cater for English students at secondary school who had been prevented from attending a live theatre performance ahead of their exam.[152]
Health[edit]The Mater Hospital in Dublin announced on 6 March that all visitors were banned, with the exception of "those who are visiting patients in critical care, vulnerable young adults, psychiatric patients or those whose loved ones are receiving end of life care" (though all children were barred).[153]
Also on 6 March, six hospitals in the province of Munster—University Hospital Limerick, University Maternity Hospital Limerick, Ennis Hospital, Nenagh Hospital, St John's Hospital and Croom Orthopaedic Hospital—announced visitors were banned and that they would be cancelling all elective surgeries and outpatient appointments (with exceptions in such cases as caesarean sections, chemotherapy and dialysis) for the following Monday and Tuesday. This announcement came after the attendance of a patient at University Hospital Limerick's emergency department two days earlier, who was later confirmed as COVID-19 positive, leading staff to self-isolate and the emergency department to be closed for three hours so that it could be deep cleaned.[154]
And again on 6 March—this time in Cork University Hospital, also in Munster—more than 60 members of staff self-isolated after a case of COVID-19 emerged there.[155]
Some nursing homes and hospitals placed stricter visitor restrictions in the hope of stopping the spread of the virus.[156][157][158]
A company making surgical face masks, for the global and local market, increased its production.[159]
Listoke Distillery in Drogheda (east of Ireland, north of Dublin) was repurposed to produce hand sanitiser.[160][161]
The Health Service Executive (HSE) began stocking up on ventilators in anticipation of a possible surge in respiratory distress cases from coronavirus.[162]
Non-urgent hospital appointments and non-emergency surgery was cancelled in order to allow hospitals to cope with the anticipated rise in COVID-19 cases.[163]
On 17 March, Minister of Health Simon Harris announced free consultations for COVID-19 testing and a recruitment drive to hire more healthcare workers including those retired and working part-time.[164]
On 24 March, it was announced that the state would take control of all private hospital facilities for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.[165]
On 29 March, the HSE unveiled new facilities at Dublin's Citywest hotel; this had a dual purpose, for self-isolation of individuals where needed and as an overflow stepdown facility for patients from hospitals not yet able to go back home.[166] The first patients began to arrive on 1 April.[167]
Media[edit]The Monday night current affairs television series Claire Byrne Live on 9 March 2020 was filmed with a reduced studio audience as an effort at social distancing; seven days later, on 16 March 2020, there was no studio audience at all and presenter Claire Byrne conducted interviews with guests—such as Minister for Health Simon Harris—live from her garden shed, as she had been advised to self-isolate.[168] On 23 March, ahead of her second week broadcasting to the nation from her shed, Byrne confirmed she had tested positive for COVID-19; the result had come as a shock to her as she had not had a temperature and assumed she had caught the common cold—though, as the week went on, her symptoms worsened, she had some difficulty breathing and experienced tiredness.[169] Byrne's diagnosis had been hinted at two days earlier when a then unnamed RTÉ staff member was reported to be COVID-19 positive.[170]
On 15 March 2020, The Irish Times announced that its building on Tara Street in Dublin would close immediately as a staff member had just been confirmed to have tested COVID-19 positive, though the paper remained in print and its website continued to be updated.[171]
On Wednesday 18 March, Newstalk radio presenter and former medical doctor Ciara Kelly announced that she had tested COVID-19 positive, though she was no longer practising, had taken precautions and had not been abroad.[172] She had continued to present the Monday and Tuesday editions of her programme, Lunchtime Live, from the hot press (a type of Irish cupboard) in her home, and Mick Heaney of The Irish Times described her Wednesday programme as "a compelling show, remarkably so considering it was hosted by an ill woman sitting in an airing cupboard".[173]
On 20 March, Celtic Media Group announced it would make staff temporarily redundant.[174]
Also on 20 March, Ryan Tubridy received a "mock" COVID-19 test on The Late Late Show.[175] Five days later, Tubridy did not turn up for his morning radio show, citing a "persistent cough"; Oliver Callan deputised.[176] Two days later, RTÉ announced that Miriam O'Callaghan would present that evening's edition of The Late Late Show, the first time in the programme's 58-year history that the role fell to a woman, the first time since his father died in 2013 that Tubridy missed a programme and the first time since Frank Hall's short-lived stint in the mid-1960s that a regular host had missed two programmes overall.[177][178][179][180] On Monday 30 March, Tubridy again did not turn up for his radio show, with Callan continuing to cover for him; later that day, Tubridy announced he had tested positive for COVID-19.[181][182] On Thursday 3 April, RTÉ confirmed O'Callaghan would again present The Late Late Show, the first time in programme history that the regular host missed two consecutive episodes.[183][184]
The National Lottery cancelled its weekly game show Winning Streak and withdrew scratchcards from shops.[185] Filming of Fair City ceased, and episodes shown twice weekly instead of the normal four.[186] TG4, deprived of its live Gaelic games coverage, aired past matches instead.[187]
COVID-related offences[edit]In the wake of fake news and rumours circulating online—including claims that a military-enforced "status red lockdown" would be enforced from 11:00 on Monday 16 March—ministers and the head of the Defence Forces made calls for people to be more responsible with the information they shared online and to only trust reputable sources.[188][189]
On 21 March, gardaí in Longford were called to a house where a 21st birthday party was underway to disperse dozens of young people who gathered in violation of social distancing.[190]
Assaults of coughing and spitting were rife. An elderly couple in County Kildare said they were afraid to attend daily Mass after receiving the coughs of an unknown man into their faces.[191][192] On 23 March, a man appeared at Blanchardstown Hospital, saying he had COVID-19 symptoms and wanted to be tested. He proceeded to either spit or cough at a nurse, who was then forced into self-isolation—it later emerged that her attacker was COVID-19 positive.[193][194][195] Also on 23 March, a nurse who had just left night duty and gone jogging in Clontarf reported that herself and an elderly couple with walking frame and wheelchair were surrounded by and coughed at by a gang of more than fifteen teenagers on bicycles.[196][197][198][199] Gardaí ordered 16,000 spit hoods (to cover the face of suspects inclined towards these acts), and warned the public that anyone caught would be charged with assault.[200][201] On 24 March, Minister for Health Simon Harris was approached near Government Buildings by a man and a woman who coughed into his face, his assailants then running off laughing.[202][203] On 25 March, a male teenager was arrested in Dungarvan, County Waterford, as part of an investigation into those deliberately coughing onto others.[204] On 26 March, bail was refused in the case of a father and son filmed spitting on two gardaí on duty in the centre of the capital city, Dublin—with the virus cited in court as an objection.[205][206]
A burglary on the LÉ George Bernard Shaw, docked at Sir John Rogerson's Quay along the River Liffey in Dublin to offer assistance to the Health Service Executive, led to the arrest of a man and a prompt appearance before court.[207][208]
Politics[edit]On 8 February, a general election took place in Ireland, before the outbreak had been declared a pandemic or reached Europe. Talks on government formation began soon afterwards and continued as the first case was confirmed in Ireland.
On 20 February, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar offered his resignation to President Michael D. Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin, remaining, however, as Taoiseach in a caretaker capacity until the formation of a new government.[209] President of Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald was the first high-profile politician affected by the spread of COVID-19, with her party cancelling events and her family entering self-isolation for a period, after McDonald confirmed on 2 March that her children attended the same school as the student with the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Ireland.[210] While in Washington ahead of Saint Patrick's Day, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced measures intended to stop COVID-19 spreading, including the closure of all schools, universities and childcare facilities from the following day, as well as the closure of all cultural institutions and the cancellation of "all indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor mass gatherings of more than 500 people".[211]
A Cabinet Sub-Committee on COVID-19 was established.[212][213][214]
On 16 March, Thomas Pringle, an independent TD representing the Donegal constituency, entered isolation due to previous contact with someone in Dublin and the high risk to his own personal health.[215][216] After returning home earlier than anticipated from his visit to the United States, the Taoiseach addressed the nation on Saint Patrick's Night during A Ministerial Broadcast by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, TD, introducing television viewers to the concept of "cocooning", i.e. "At a certain point… we will advise the elderly and people who have a long-term illness to stay at home for several weeks".[217][218][219] The speech, which Varadkar made under Section 112 of the Broadcast Act, was the most watched television event in Irish history, surpassing the previous record held by The Late Late Toy Show by an additional total of about 25% and was widely distributed globally.[220][221] It was also plagiarised by Peter Bellew, the chief operating officer at British low-cost airline group EasyJet.[222]
On 18 March, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, the independent MEP representing the Midlands–North-West constituency, announced that he and his family would begin self-isolating after his daughter exhibited symptoms of COVID-19.[223]
On 19 March, Dáil Éireann reconvened under social distancing measures to pass emergency legislation. At the written request of Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the sitting was limited to 48 TDs (11 each representing Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, four Greens, three members of the Regional Group and two members of all other parties and groups). The legislation—Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Bill 2020—passed all stages, and, following requests by opposition TDs, included a sunset provision for review in November.[224] During the sitting, Eamon Ryan called on the Irish to grow lettuce on their window sills: "Let's get every south facing window sill in this country and lets plant our seeds in the next week so that if there is any supply crisis in food in two or three months time when this really hits hard, we'll have our salads ready to go".[225]
On 19 March, it was reported that Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy had been in self-isolation for the past week after returning from a visit abroad to see family. Murphy had set off before travel advice against doing so was issued and—while he had "not been in direct physical contact with any colleagues"—he, nevertheless, was well enough to continue his work remotely.[226]
On 20 March, Seanad Éireann—also sitting in reduced numbers—passed the legislation after a three-hour debate.[227] President Higgins wrote the legislation into law later that day, giving the state the power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes in order to restrict the pandemic.[14]
On 23 March, Tánaiste Simon Coveney revealed he had tested negative for COVID-19. He underwent the test after being contact traced via the positive result of Claire Byrne, whom he had sat beside on live television less than two weeks previously.[228] It was believed that Coveney was the first member of the Varadkar cabinet to be tested for the virus.[229]
On 24 March, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced from Government Buildings the extension of all existing measures until 19 April—as well as stricter measures, among which were: the limiting of social gatherings to four people (unless members of the same household); the shutting of all non-essential retail outlets still open—effective from midnight—bringing an official end to hairdressing, theatres, gyms, leisure centres, betting offices, marts and other market places, casinos and bingo halls, playgrounds, holiday caravan parks, organised indoor and outdoor social events of any kind, including all sport (some of which, such as horse racing, was then still being held behind closed doors); the limitation of cafes and restaurants to takeaway and delivery services.

Thus, Irish Catholics were permitted to forgo the obligation "to physically attend Sunday Mass", particularly if they were elderly or had underlying health conditions known to be worsened by infection with the virus. Bishops advised that members of the congregation should be informed of how they might "participate in Mass via local radio and online".[244] Holy water fonts would be emptied; hand sanitiser made available at each entrance of the church; the sign of peace expressed preferably through other means than the tradition of hand shaking; the Eucharist to be taken in the hand and not the mouth; only one person to drink from the chalice; priests to avail of cotton buds or surgical gloves while engaged in the anointing of the sick; priests to make the sign of the cross over the baby during baptism without touching the child's head; no shaking the hands of the bereaved during funerals.[245]
