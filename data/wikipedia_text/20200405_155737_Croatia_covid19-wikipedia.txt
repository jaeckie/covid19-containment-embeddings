In March 2020, a cluster of cases were reported in numerous Croatian cities. On 12 March, the first recovery was reported, and on 18 March the first death from the virus was confirmed.
The pandemic in Croatia occurred during the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.[2] On 22 March an intense earthquake hit Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, causing problems in enforcement of social distancing measures set out by the Government.

Concerns were raised about the increased probability of the virus entering Croatia because of the number of Chinese workers working on Pelješac Bridge. Some of the institutions in Croatia preemptively reacted to the potential threat.[5]
The airports in Croatia were prepared and they started going through passive measures and being vigilant.[5]
The Ministry of Health warned those travelling to China to avoid sick people, animals, and markets, not to eat any raw or semi-cooked animals, and to wash their hands often and to notify their doctor of their plans to travel to China.[citation needed]
After relieving Milan Kujundžić from the position of Health Minister, on 31 January, Vili Beroš was confirmed as the new Health Minister by the Croatian Parliament.[6] Prime Minister Andrej Plenković cited the coronavirus problem as one of the reasons for the change.[7] Beroš held a meeting with the Ministry's Crisis Headquarters on his first day regarding the coronavirus epidemic.[8]
The Croatian Public Health Institute introduced special health inspection measures on 2 February for persons arriving from China or had been in China recently.[9] On 3 February, Beroš met with Stella Kyriakidou, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, and Janez Lenarčič, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, to discuss the situation with the coronavirus.[10] Following a meeting with the EU health ministers on 13 February, Beroš said that the closure of EU borders is a possible measure.[11]
Beroš adopted a decision to establish a quarantine unit at the Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljević" in Zagreb on 21 February, for suspected or confirmed infected persons with coronavirus.[12] A Croatian citizen who spent time on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined in that unit on the following day. He had no symptoms, but was placed in a 14-day quarantine as a precautionary measure.[13] Plenković said that the Crisis Headquarters will meet on a daily basis and that the Government will take any measure necessary to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.[14]

On 20 March, Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc in Rijeka started with an online virtual program Zajc With You on their YouTube channel, as an act responsibility and in solidarity with its audience, citizens of Rijeka and the wider community, especially those most vulnerable ones, either because of their age or because they are "on the front line of defense against the virus". Some ensembles will not continue their regular and usual work, because it involves gathering of more people, such as orchestras or choirs, and physical contact, such as ballet ensembles.[18][19]
Economy[edit]Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Zdravko Marić was asked to comment on to what extent the virus has affected the national economy, and if it could trigger an economic crisis. He said:
"It is very difficult to forecast what will happen because the situation is changing on a daily basis. The situation is very serious, so I have to choose my words carefully. A lot of people are making off the cuff statements. No one in government is negating the problem, the problem is quite evident. But right now we cannot forecast the scope of its effect. No one can. Primarily because no one knows how long the coronavirus crisis will last."[20]Minister Marić added that it was far too early to make any predictions regarding the national economy in 2020 and budgetary revenues:
"Right now I don't want to speculate on what its effects will be. Our budgetary projection for economic growth, GDP growth this year is 2.5%, it remains to be seen if we will have to adjust the figure down and if so by how much."[20][20]The city of Dubrovnik began to brace for the economic impact that the coronavirus could cause in Croatia.[21]
