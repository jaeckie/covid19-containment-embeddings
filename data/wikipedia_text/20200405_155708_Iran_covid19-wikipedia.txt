During the 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom.[3]
The virus may have been brought to the country by a merchant from Qom who had travelled to China.[4] Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus in the Middle East,[5][4] with more than ten countries tracing their cases back to Iran by 28 February.[4] Government's actions include cancellation of public events and Friday prayers, closure of schools, universities, shopping centres and bazaars as well as holy shrines, and banning of festival celebrations.[6][7] Economic measures were also announced to help families and businesses. The government has rejected plans to quarantine entire cities and areas, and heavy traffic between cities continued ahead of Nowruz despite the government's intention to limit travel. The government later announced a ban on travel between cities following an increase in number of new cases.[8][7]
Some non-Iranian-government sources estimates of the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are much higher than official values.[9][10][11] The Iranian government has also been accused of cover-ups, censorship and mismanagement.[12][13][14][4] However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says that it has not seen problems with Iran's reported figures,[15] although later a WHO official indicated that only a fifth of the cases may be identified in Iran due to testing being limited only to severe cases initially, as was the situation with some European countries.[16]
Multiple Iranian government ministers and senior officials have been diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive, as well as 23 members of the Iranian Parliament (around 8% of all MPs).[17] At least 12 sitting or former Iranian politicians and officials had died from the virus by 17 March 2020.[6] Notable individuals reported to have died from COVID-19 include Hadi Khosroshahi,[18] Mohammad Mirmohammadi, Hossein Sheikholeslam, Fatemeh Rahbar, Reza Mohammadi Langroudi,[19] Mohammad-Reza Rahchamani,[20] Nasser Shabani,[21] Hashem Bathaie Golpayegani,[22] and Hamid Kahram.[23][24]

Other international reactionsOne Dubai-based newspaper wrongly claimed in a front-page headline that all cases of the new coronavirus in the region came from the Islamic Republic.

US sanctionsThe US sanctions have made difficulties for the governmental and non-governmental institutions to provide medication for people who are infected by the Coronavirus. Sending medical supplies to Iran through the recently established Swiss channel requires a written permission from the US. Recently, sanctions on 12 new Iranian entities were imposed by the US Department of State. However, according to the Trump administration, Iran is using sanctions "as an excuse to hide their own incompetence, including a reluctance to take the necessary tough measures to restrict population movements."[238]
While the US sanctions legally allow pharmaceuticals and humanitarian products to be sold to Iran, due to their nature, very few banks are willing to risk sanctions by trading with Iran.[239][240] This has severely limited the medical supplies available to the Iranian public health system in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. One right wing lobby group in the United States, United Against Nuclear Iran, has argued to stop all global humanitarian trade with Iran and prevent medical supplies from reaching the country.[241]
The UK, Pakistan, China, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Group of 77, and experts are pressing the US to ease sanctions on Iran to help it fight the growing coronavirus outbreak.[242][243][244][245][246][247] However, fresh sanctions on individuals and companies linked with allegedly linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and trade with Iran was imposed on 26 March 2020.[248][249]
The United States Government rejected allegations by Iranian regime and asserted that sanctions do not include the import of medicine and medical facilities to Iran. Morgan Ortagus, the spokeswoman for the State Department, also wrote in a tweet, the funds that Iran needs to fight against the spread of coronavirus can easily be obtained from," billions in Khamenei's tax-free hedge fund." [250]
Non-government estimatesIn a preprint paper pending for review on medRxiv journal, Tuite et al. estimated that as of 25 February, c. 18,300 infections (95% confidence interval: 3,770–53,470; best-case scenario: 380–5,320 cases) could have occurred in Iran, based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, the latter compiled from the data in the past. They concluded that Iran is likely to experience an "epidemic of significant size", while lack of identified cases in countries with close travel ties to Iran are because the cases are "likely being missed, rather than being truly absent".[251]
The government of Iran had insisted that there was no confirmed COVID-19 in Iran before 19 February 2020, when the first cases were announced.[252][253] However, a letter claimed to be[weasel words] from the Ministry of Health to the office of the President that circulated on social media[attribution needed] suggests that the Iranian authorities were aware of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths many days[weasel words] before the official announcement. Government officials said that the letter was a fake.[254][255] Another letter also circulated on social media;[attribution needed] it was signed by interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli and sent to Health Minister Saeed Namaki to request that the announcement of coronavirus outbreak be delayed[by whom?] until after the parliamentary election to avoid a low turnout of voters.[dubious  – discuss] The government has also denied this claim.[256]
On 9 March, Graeme Wood stated that he deems the official count "certainly an undercount", and provided alternative estimates which he calls "doomsday figures".[257]
World Health Organization verificationOn 28 February 2020, Michael Ryan, chief of the WHO health emergencies programme told the press that the mortality rate in Iran indicated its outbreak might be more widespread than realised.[258]
On 2 March 2020, The World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom said in an interview with CNBC that the WHO has its own mechanism for checking national health authorities' statistics and did not see problems with the official Iranian government SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 counts.[259]
On 17 March 2020, WHO regional emergency director Rick Brennan said the number of cases reported in Iran could represent only about 20% of the real numbers because testing was restricted to severe cases, as is the case even in some wealthy European countries. He added "We’ve said the weakest link in their chain is the data. They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up... [t]here’s a great commitment and they are taking it seriously from the highest level of government".[16]
Other sourcesMasoud Pezeshkian, the First Deputy of the Parliament of Iran, claimed on 3 March 2020 that the figures reported by Iran's health ministry are "not real".[260]
Member of parliament for Qom Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani claimed on 24 February 2020 that COVID-19 had arrived in Qom three weeks prior, in early February, that the first death had occurred on 13 February but was not announced by officials, and that the true number of COVID-19 deaths in Qom was 50.[9][261] Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi denied giving false figures, and stated that the death count was 12 with a total of 66 infections.[262]
On 28 February 2020 BBC reported 210 deaths have occurred in Iran, citing "sources in the country's health system", while the official number for the day was 34.[258] Kianush Jahanpur, the spokesman for the health ministry rejected the BBC report in a tweet.[10]
On 12 March, The Economist wrote "[s]ome in the government think the actual number of cases is closer to 100,000", while the official count of infected people was about 9,000.[263]
On 22 March, Radio Farda reported that "based on the statements made by local officials in various parts of Iran", around 2,372 have died, while the official death toll reached 1,556.[264] Radio Farda also said on 21 March that since Iran's government statistics only include those who had tested positive for the disease, due to a lack of test kits, deaths may be registered as respiratory complications or influenza. They put their estimate of the number of infections at 16,000 in Tehran alone when the official figure given was 20,610 for the whole country on that date.[265]
On 12 March, The Washington Post published satellite images and analysis provided by Maxar Technologies, saying that vast burial pits were being excavated near Qom, said to be used to accommodate the potentially increasing number of victims in the city. The digging of the new section of burial pits began on 21 February, only two days after the government announced their first cases of COVID-19, and then rapidly expanded. The number of fresh graves suggests preparation for a far larger number of deaths.[266] Qom municipality official responsible for the city's burial sites said "the graves had been planned before the outbreak as part of usual procedures in the cemetery", and some observers pointed that overall length of the purported 100 yards cannot accommodate more than about 75-100 graves.[267]
