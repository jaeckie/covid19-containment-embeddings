The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have reached North Macedonia in February 2020.[3]
The initial contagion in the country was mainly connected with the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy as there are circa 70,000 residents[4]  of Italy from North Macedonia and due to a mass hysteria about the virus itself there was a mass returning to North Macedonia.[5]

She had been in Italy for a month and was sick for two weeks. Upon returning to North Macedonia, she immediately reported herself to the clinic.[6][7] This case was isolated and didn't lead to further infections.

March[edit]On 6 March, two more cases were confirmed positive: a married couple from Balanci, Centar Župa, who were residents of Brescia, Italy, and presumably returned to the country out of fear of the virus.[8] They entered North Macedonia on 27 February and went to the clinic in Debar on 2 March. They were not initially tested for SARS-CoV-2, but when their symptoms were getting worse they were tested on 6 March. After getting positive results, the couple was transferred to the Clinic in Skopje to be taken care of.[9]
On 9 March the number of infected people in the country increased to 7 - three family members of the cases registered on 6 of March and Nina Caca Biljanovska, the director of the Clinic for Skin Diseases in Skopje. Biljanovska's case caused controversy, as she did not self-isolate after returning from a vacation in Italy. Moreover, she had continued going to work and was a speaker at a conference attended by 100 people before getting tested. The Minister of health subsequently fired her.[10][11]
On 10 March, after a formal request from the mayor of Debar[12] (the city where 5 of the 7 cases were found)  and the controversies regarding Biljanovska the Ministry of Health of North Macedonia implemented stronger measures to prevent further spreading of the virus, including a temporary two week closure of all education institutes (from kindergartens to universities), prohibition of traveling to the most infected countries (China, Korea, Italy, France, Germany, etc.), prohibition of all public events and closure of sport events to the public.[13] Later that day the first case was confirmed to tested negatively on the repeated coronavirus test.
