Statistics[edit]Hospital beds capacity, ventilators and ECMO machines[edit]On 19 March 2020, the Russian Government reported the following data. More than 55 thousand infectious beds were deployed, including more than 12 thousand intensive care units and 396 observatories. 7.5 thousand Melzer boxes were prepared. Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices. Today, 6 thousand infectious diseases doctors and almost 2 thousand pulmonologists, more than 18 thousand nurses are ready to provide medical assistance.[98]
The independent journalistic website proekt.media reports that as soon as the number of cases of coronavirus in Russia reaches 800 thousand people, and the number of hospitalized — 160 thousand, ventilation devices in hospitals will run out.According to the OECD, Russia ranks third in the number of beds per capita. However, in the case of Russia, beds are literally only beds. In terms of equipment — for example, CT and MRI devices — Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. Rosstat does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger.
[99]
Data collected by the news website Meduza indicates that Russia's supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries.[100]
Government responses[edit]Russia implemented preventive measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country by imposing quarantines, carrying raids on potential virus carriers and using facial recognition to impose quarantine measures.[102] Measures to prevent a crisis in Russia include banning the export of medical masks, random checks on the Moscow Metro, and cancellation of large-scale events by schools. The Russian government has also taken measures to prevent foreign citizens from heavily affected countries from visiting Russia.[7]
The Russian consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor advised tourists to refrain from visiting Wuhan and stay away from Chinese zoos and markets selling animals and seafood. The agency also said that development of a vaccine against the virus was underway, relying on the WHO's recommendations.[103][104]

Testing[edit]As of 23 March, Russia has 4 testing systems and has carried out over 165 thousand tests for the coronavirus[112][113] which is among the highest testing numbers in the world.[114] Two private lab companies started testing on 26 March. According to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, as of 25 March, 141 state laboratories were conducting tests in 79 federal subjects.[115] There are plans to increase the number of reference centres across the country to 15.[106][112][116] On 27 March, the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) registered two more test systems.[117]
Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization's representative in Russia, stated that Russia, in accordance with WHO recommendations, "started testing literally at the end of January.”[118] Coronavirus testing in Russia was provided by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Novosibirsk and had to be verified there.[119][120] There was concern that the tests may have insufficient sensitivity,[119][120] despite the fact that the tests were verified in China since early February, showed the degree of sensitivity similar to or higher than other tests and the lab has been approved by the World Health Organization.[119] Since 23 March, European Russia doesn't send their batches to Novosibirsk for verification but verify them in a Moscow reference centre.
There was some skepticism about the accuracy of Russia's reported infection figures. Anastasia Vasilyeva, leader of the Doctors' Alliance organisation loosely aligned to the Russian opposition and doctor for opposition figure Alexei Navalny, made a series of videos accusing the authorities of concealing the true number of coronavirus cases by using pneumonia and acute respiratory infection as a diagnosis instead. Health officials rejected the allegation, and President Putin addressed concerns about statistics, saying that the government is not covering up the number of cases, though might not have the full picture. The WHO's representative to Russia, Dr. Vujnovic, also expressed skepticism at the allegation.[119][120][109][121]
