Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly Ilia, Achaea and Zakynthos). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country.

Suspension of religious services[edit]On 9 March 2020, the Standing Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, the country's established Eastern Orthodox Church, discussed the coronavirus epidemic and issued an encyclical that was sent to the dioceses of the Church of Greece. Having stated that the Holy Communion could by no means be a way of transmission of diseases, the Standing Synod decided to continue offering and receiving the Holy Communion.[153][154][155] The Synod's decision sparked controversy.[156][157] The Synod's stance prompted criticism from the opposition Syriza party, with former prime minister Alexis Tsipras criticising the hierarchy, as did former health minister Pavlos Polakis.[157] Some high-profile Greek medical doctors publicly supported the continuation of practicing Holy Communion, drawing criticism from the Greek Association of Hospital Doctors.[158] (Greek: Ομοσπονδία Ενώσεων Νοσοκομειακών Γιατρών Ελλάδος (OENGE)).

On 1 April, the Standing Synod of the Church of Greece issued a statement that urged the faithful to abide by the government's sanitary regulations and to refrain from attending services in churches; it also re-affirmed its stance on the Holy Communion set out in the statement of 9 March 2020 and expressed hope that solemn public celebration of Easter (Pascha), which would properly be on 19 April, could be performed on the night of 26 May, the eve of the Leave-Taking (Apodosis) of Pascha.[165][166]
Refugees and migrants[edit]On February 27, prime minister Mitsotakis announced that illegal entry into Greece would no longer tolerated; as this would be a threat to public health in Greece.[167] According to various estimates about 150,600 displaced persons are located in Greece.[168] In the existing camps, doctors, NGOs and refugees considered that measures against the spread of the coronavirus are lacking as people live in overcrowded spaces with little access to proper health services.[169][168][170] On March 24, 21 international human rights organizations active in Greece including Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and ActionAid published an open call to the Greek government to take immediate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Reception and Identification Centres, where refugees live. The conditions of the centres were criticised as deplorable and dangerous to both the refugees and public health.[171] Médecins Sans Frontières which has a clinic near the Moria camp declared that the numbers in the camps had reached levels such that they could not handle an outbreak of infection within the camp. The government further announced that movement of refugees outside the camps would be restricted as facilities are prepared for confirmed cases,[172] and that it would only allow small goups of refugees and migrants to temporarily exit the camps to obtain basic supplies.[169]
On March 28, the Turkish interior minister announced that 5,800 refugees and migrants that had unsuccessfully attempted to cross the Greek-Turkish border had been relocated to Turkish cities due to the coronavirus pandemic.

On March 31, it was reported that an African couple were infected in the Ritsona refugee camp in Central Greece, the wife having given birth.[174][175]
