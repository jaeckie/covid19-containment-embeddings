Cases traced to travel from Egypt[edit]In addition to the confirmed cases within Egypt, there have been a number of documented cases that were detected in other countries and traced to travel from Egypt.

Case estimates[edit]Based partly on multiple confirmed COVID-19 cases in other countries being linked to travel in Egypt, infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto, who studied the disparity between official and presumed infection rates, estimated that the number of COVID-19 cases in Egypt to be between 6,270–45,070 presumed cases on 15 March 2020, which was reported on by British newspaper The Guardian and U.S. newspaper The New York Times.[34][44] This unofficial count was far higher than the official count of 126 at the time. The Egyptian Ministry of Health dismissed this estimate as "completely false", and the ministry also said that it reports confirmed cases in the country with "full transparency".[44]
