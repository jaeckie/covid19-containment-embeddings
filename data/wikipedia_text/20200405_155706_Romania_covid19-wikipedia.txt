On 22 February, the Romanian government announced several preventive measures including designation of five hospitals as isolation centers for new cases, purchase and placement of thermal scanners in international airports and specially designated lines for passengers coming from areas affected by COVID-19 outbreak.[4][5][6][3]
On 25 February, new measures were imposed. Upon arrival on the Romanian territory, all asymptomatic travelers from the affected areas, respectively Hubei, the 11 localities in Italy, and any remaining passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship will go directly to the quarantine, for a period for 14 days.

Thus, citizens arriving from other provinces or cities in mainland China, other localities in Lombardy, Veneto or Emilia-Romagna regions of Italy, as well as areas and localities in South Korea and Iran not previously specified for institutionalised quarantine, enter 14 days of self-isolation at home immediately upon returning to Romania.[11]
8–12 March: Public gatherings banned, schools suspendedOn 8 March, the Head of the Department for Emergency Situations, Raed Arafat, announced a ban on all indoor or outdoor activities involving the participation of more than 1,000 people (these numbers were subsequently changed, see below). These restrictions are valid until 31 March, when a new assessment will be made.[12] After Northern Italy was put under quarantine on 8 March, low-cost airline Wizz Air suspended all flights to Treviso and Bergamo until 3 April. Likewise, Blue Air cancelled all flights to and from Milan for 8 and 9 March. In the same day, flights from and to Italy have been suspended.[13][14] In a press conference, Interior Minister Marcel Vela stated that if a school reports even a case, courses will be suspended throughout the school.[15]
On 9 March, the officials announced the cessation of flights to and from Italy, at all airports in the country, until 23 March.[16] On the same day, the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations has decided to close all schools in Romania, starting on 11 March until 22 March, with the possibility of extending the measure. All bus rides and rail transport to and from Italy were suspended from 10 March until 31 March.[17][18] The Committee also decided to establish a series of obligations for food units and for public and private providers of passenger transport, such as frequent disinfection of surfaces, avoiding crowds in commercial spaces, frequent disinfection of the passenger compartment in the means of transport, etc.[19]
On 11 March, the Government published a list of fifteen guidelines regarding the "responsible social behavior in preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19)".[20] The authorities have imposed a ban on sports, scientific, religious, cultural or entertainment events with over 100 participants in closed spaces until 31 March.[21] Likewise, the public activities for museums were suspended until 31 March.[22]
On 12 March, Serbian authorities have closed seven border points with Romania to prevent the spread of coronavirus.[23] On the same day, the Romanian Ombudsman asked President Klaus Iohannis to declare the state of emergency and the Romanian Parliament to approve it. In a televised statement, the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Health, Nelu Tătaru [ro], said that the current situation does not impose such an extreme measure.[24] The Romanian Football Federation decided to postpone all football matches in Romania until 31 March.[25] Interior Minister Marcel Vela announced that the border crossing points with low traffic have been closed so that employees there to be directed to high traffic posts.[26] Health Minister Victor Costache issued an order prohibiting the export of medicines and medical equipment for six months.[27]
13 March: First infected politicianOn March 13, Vergil Chițac [ro], former admiral, who acts as an independent in the PNL senators' group, was diagnosed with COVID-19. He isolated himself after finding out that a French parliamentarian, with whom he had been traveling to Brussels, was found with coronavirus.[28] On March 9, Chițac attended a party meeting with over 100 people. Parliamentary sources claim that he was also present in the Senate on March 12, when he attended the group and plenary sessions.[28] In these conditions, all members of the National Political Bureau of PNL self-isolated at home. Interim Prime-minister Ludovic Orban announced that all PNL senators have an obligation to isolate themselves and that he will self-isolate at Vila Lac 1.[29] He also announced that all ministers will be tested for coronavirus and self-isolate in their cabinets.[30]
14–21 March: State of emergency declared, parliamentary activity suspendedOn March 14, after over 101 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus, Romania entered the third COVID-19 scenario.[31] The third scenario goes from 101 to 2,000 cases. In the third scenario the doctors will perform epidemiological screening in the tents installed in the hospitals' yards, and the hospitals of infectious diseases will treat only cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.[32] Likewise, the authorities will be able to impose quarantine at home, not just in hospitals, as in many areas the capacities of medical units could be exceeded.[33] At the same time, according to the plan in the third scenario, public gatherings with more than 50 people are banned.[34] Three more liberals have been diagnosed with COVID-19, all contacts of senator Vergil Chițac.[35] Marcel Ciolacu, President of the Chamber of Deputies, announced that the Parliament will suspend its activity for a week. However, the activities will be carried out online.[36] Also on March 14, President Klaus Iohannis announced that he decided to decree the state of emergency in Romania starting March 16.[37]
By 15 March, there were 139 confirmed cases and 9 recoveries.[38]
On March 16, Iohannis issued the decree establishing the state of emergency in Romania for a period of 30 days and insisted that the implementation of the measures included in the decree is being made gradually.[39] The schools will be closed during the state of emergency. If necessary, prices may be capped on medicines and medical equipment, on strictly necessary foods and on public utility services (electricity and heat, gas, water supply, sanitation, fuels, etc.). Also, gradual measures can be taken, if the situation gets worse, only after an evaluation of the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations. These include temporary closure of restaurants, hotels, cafes, clubs, gradual closure of borders, or limiting or prohibiting the movement of vehicles or persons in/to certain areas.[40][41] On March 19, the Parliament convened a joint online session and unanimously adopted the decree issued by Iohannis.[42]
Until March 17, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated the return to the country for 137 Romanians who were abroad, either as tourists, in transit, or in medical emergency situations and who were directly affected by the measures adopted by the states in which they were.[43] Later that same day, the government issued its first Military Ordinance, in response to the ongoing health crisis.[44] Four days later, on March 21, a second Military Ordinance has been issued: no groups larger than 3 persons on the streets. Leaving home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. for no reason is prohibited. All shopping malls are closed, except for the sale of food, veterinary or pharmaceutical products and cleaning services. It is forbidden to enter the territory of Romania, of foreign citizens and stateless persons, except when they transit through the territory of Romania, through the transit corridor, organised by agreements with the neighboring states (more exceptions are made for other categories like: residents, family members, and others).[45][46]
22 March-present: First COVID-19 deaths, nationwide lockdown, Suceava quarantineOn March 22, the first three deaths were reported in Romania. All three had preexisting conditions: one was on dialysis, one had terminal lung cancer, and one had diabetes.[47][48]
Following a surge in new confirmed cases, on March 24, the government announced Military Ordinance No.3, instituting a national lockdown and calling in the military to support police and Gendarmerie personnel in enforcing the new restrictions. Movement outside the home or household is prohibited, with some exceptions (work, buying food or medicine etc.). People over 65 years-old are allowed to leave their homes only between 11 a.m.-1 p.m.[49][50] Two days later, on March 26, the state airline Tarom suspended all internal flights.[51]
A fourth Military Ordinance has been issued on March 29, further strengthening previously imposed fines and restrictions.[52] Two more would soon follow, issued close to the end of the next day; namely, a fifth, extending the ban on international travel,[53] and a sixth, placing Suceava, along with eight contiguous communes, under total quarantine,[54][55] the first Romanian city to be placed under complete lockdown since the start of the outbreak in late February, holding over a quarter of all infected cases,[55] and about two thirds of all infected medical personnel.[56][57] Some hospital staff have quit, others have signed a petition stating they "are sent to death barehanded".[58]
On April 2, Harghita reported its first case, becoming the last county in Romania to report at least one case.[59] Two days later, on April 4, a seventh Military Ordinance has been issued, further extending the national lockdown period, and placing yet a second town under strict quarantine.[60]
CasesOn 14 March, 18 days after the diagnosis of the first case of infection with SARS-CoV-2, Romania surpassed the threshold of 100 confirmed cases. 49% of those diagnosed were outside the country prior to diagnosis.[61] In 35% of cases, patients were previously in Italy, the country most affected by the pandemic in the European Union. These people were the main sources of transmission of the virus to the other 50%, in a single situation being unable to identify a suggestive epidemiological context for the diagnosed patient.[61] Two diagnosed people (cases #17 and #27) were responsible for infecting 22% of the number of patients.[61] This situation was possible because each of them hid from authorities, in the initial phase, the fact that they had previously travelled to an area at risk of infection, which delayed the initiation of the epidemiological investigation and exposed more people to the risk of infection. More than half of the cases (54%) were diagnosed in three counties: Bucharest, Timiș and Hunedoara.[61] A patient out of three was diagnosed in Bucharest. Only six of the first 100 infected Romanian patients were older than 70, the age at which coronavirus often poses serious health problems, especially when the infected one also suffers from associated diseases.[61] Of the first 100 patients, only one case was serious, requiring ICU admission, while nine patients recovered, and 90 had mild to moderate symptoms.[61]
On 15 March, the Ministry of Health stopped publishing data on sex, age, origin, contacts and other details of individual cases. The information about the new cases were communicated in two newsletters per day, one at 10 a.m., the other at 6 p.m.[62] From 19 March, the reporting of the new confirmed cases was done only once a day, at 1 p.m.[63]
Statistics
As of 18 March, a plurality (29%) of COVID-19 cases were people between the ages of 40 and 49. Of the patients, 51% are women, 44% are men, and children – 5%.[144]
ImpactEconomyDuring the second week of March, the Bucharest Stock Exchange recorded losses on all five trading sessions, the main index BET collapsing with 17.6%, the steepest decline since December 2018.[145]
On 16 March, the National Bank of Romania announced a reference rate of 4.8242 lei/euro, a historical maximum for the single European currency against the leu.[146] The leu continued its depreciation, reaching a maximum of 4.8448 lei/euro on 17 March.[147]
EducationOn 9 March, interim Prime-minister Ludovic Orban announced the closure of all schools between 11 and 22 March. The measure targeted all kindergartens, primary, secondary and high schools in Romania, both public and private, according to Education Minister Monica Anisie [ro].[148] The decision affects 3.5 million students.[149] Likewise, several universities in the major student centres suspended their courses. These include the University of Bucharest, the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, the Politehnica University of Bucharest, the Babeș-Bolyai University, the West University of Timișoara, etc.[150][151][152] Furthermore, Anisie announced that, as a measure of prevention and control of the illnesses with COVID-19 in schools, the Ministry of Education had decided to suspend all county and regional school olympiads, as well as sports competitions.[153]
The show Teleșcoală (Teleschool), announced by the Ministry of Education and dedicated to the students who stay at home during the period when the schools are closed, started on TVR 2 on 16 March, at 9 a.m. Students can follow, from Monday to Friday, mathematics, Romanian, biology, history and geography classes.[154][155]
On 16 March, Anisie announced that schools would remain closed while the state of emergency was in place, at least until after the Easter holidays.[156][157]
On 1 April, in response to a fake news story which had gained traction on social media and was being destributed on WhatsApp[158][159], saying that students would have to return to school in less than a week, Anisie and the Ministry of Education issued an official statement condemning the spread of false information and promised to provide in the next few days the date for the re-opening of schools, as well as the national examinations.[160][161][162]
