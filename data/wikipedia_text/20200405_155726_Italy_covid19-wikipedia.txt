An ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus.[2] One week later an Italian man repatriated back to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalised and confirmed as the third case in Italy.[3] A cluster of cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February,[4] and 60 additional cases and the first deaths on 22 February.[5] By the beginning of March, the virus had spread to all regions of Italy.[6]
On 31 January, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency. In February, eleven municipalities in northern Italy were identified as the centres of the two main Italian clusters and placed under quarantine. The majority of positive cases in other regions traced back to these two clusters.[7] On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, and on the following day to all of Italy, placing more than 60 million people in quarantine.[8][9][10] On 11 March 2020, Conte prohibited nearly all commercial activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies.[11][12] On 21 March, the Italian government closed all non-essential businesses and industries, with additional restrictions to movement of people.[13]
On 6 March 2020, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols that might be employed.[14][15][16]
As of 4 April 2020[update], Italy is one of the world's centres of active coronavirus cases with 88,274 active cases.[17] The total of confirmed cases is 124,632, with 15,362 deaths, and 20,996 recoveries or dismissals.[1] By 4 April, Italy had conducted about 657,200 tests for the virus.[18] Due to the finite number of tests performed, the real number of infected people in Italy, as in other countries, is estimated to be higher than the official count.[19][20][21] On 19 March, Italy became the country with the highest number of confirmed deaths in the world.[22]

On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) reported the identification of a novel coronavirus (later identified as the SARS-CoV-2) as the cause.[23] In late January 2020, following the developments of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China, on 3 February, Italy set up enhanced screening measures, including thermal cameras and medical staff at airports.[24]
TimelineFirst confirmed casesOn 31 January, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Rome. A Chinese couple, originally from Wuhan, who had arrived in Italy on 23 January via Milan Malpensa Airport, travelled from the airport to Verona, then to Parma, arriving in Rome on 28 January. The next afternoon, they developed a cough, and by evening the man had a fever; the couple were taken to the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases where they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalised.[26][2]  On 2 February, a team from the same institute composed of scientists Maria Rosaria Capobianchi, Francesca Colavita, and Concetta Castilletti isolated the genomic sequence of the virus and uploaded it to GenBank.[27][28]
On 31 January, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency with the duration of six months. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was the first EU country to take this kind of precautionary measure.[29] The government also introduced thermal scanners and temperature checks on international passengers arriving at Italian airports.[24]
On 6 February, an Italian repatriated from Wuhan tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in Italy to three.[30]
On 22 February, the repatriated Italian recovered and was discharged from the hospital.[31] On 22 and 26 February, the two previously infected Chinese tourists tested negative for COVID-19 at Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute in Rome.[32]
Lombardy clusterThe Lombardy outbreak came to light when a 38-year-old Italian tested positive in Codogno, a comune in the province of Lodi. On 14 February, he felt unwell and went to a doctor in Castiglione d'Adda. He was prescribed treatments for influenza.[33] On 16 February, as the man's condition worsened, he went to Codogno Hospital, reporting respiratory problems.[33] Initially there was no suspicion of COVID-19, so no additional precautionary measures were taken, and the virus was able to infect other patients and health workers.[34] On 19 February, the wife of the patient revealed he had met an Italian friend who had returned from China on 21 January, who subsequently tested negative.[33] Later, the patient, his pregnant wife and a friend tested positive.[33] On 20 February, three more cases were confirmed after the patients reported symptoms of pneumonia.[35] Thereafter, extensive screenings and checks were performed on everyone that had possibly been in contact with or near the infected subjects.[36] It has been subsequently reported that the origin of these cases has a possible connection to the first European local transmission that occurred in Munich, Germany, on 19 January 2020, consistent with phylogenetic analysis of viral genome.[37][38][39] The 38-year-old man was asymptomatic for weeks, reportedly led an active social life and potentially interacted with dozens of people before spreading the virus at Codogno Hospital.[33][34] Afterward, he was transferred to Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia,[40] and his wife to Sacco Hospital in Milan.[41][42]
On 21 February 16 more cases were confirmed – 14 in Lombardy, including the doctor who prescribed treatments to the 38-year-old Codogno man,[33] and two in Veneto. On 22 February, a 77-year-old woman from Casalpusterlengo, who suffered from pneumonia and visited the same emergency room as the 38-year-old from Codogno, died in Lombardy.[43] Including the 78-year-old man who died in Veneto, the number of cases in Italy rose to 79.[5][44] Of the 76 newly discovered cases, 54 were found in Lombardy, including one patient in San Raffaele Hospital in Milan[45] and eight patients in Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia,[46] 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two in Lazio and one in Piedmont.[47]
On 23 February, a 68-year-old woman with cancer from Trescore Cremasco died in Crema. The number of cases in Italy rose to 152, including fourteen patients being treated at Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia.[48][49] On 24 February, an 84-year-old man with pre-existing medical conditions from Villa di Serio died in Bergamo while hospitalised in the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital.[50] An 88-year-old man from Caselle Landi, who resided in Codogno, died on the same day.[51][52] An 80-year-old man from Castiglione d’Adda died at the Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan. He was previously hospitalised in Lodi because of a heart attack, and then transferred to Milan when confirmed as positive.[52][53][54] A 62-year-old man with pre-existing medical conditions from Castiglione d'Adda died in Sant'Anna Hospital in Como.[55] Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana announced that the number of cases in Lombardy had risen to 172, with a total of 229 confirmed in Italy.[56][57][58] On 25 February, an 84-year-old man from Nembro, a 91-year-old man from San Fiorano and an 83-year-old woman from Codogno died from complications caused by the infections.[59][60][61]
The number of cases in Emilia-Romagna rose to 23, spreading through the provinces of Piacenza, Parma, Modena and Rimini. These were all linked to the Lombardy cluster.[62][63][64][65][66] A new case linked to the outbreak in Lombardy appeared in Palermo, Sicily, when a 60-year-old woman from Bergamo tested positive and was admitted to Cervello Hospital.[67][68] A 49-year-old man who previously visited Codogno tested positive in Pescia, Tuscany.[69] Officials in Liguria confirmed that a 72-year-old female tourist from Castiglione d'Adda tested positive in Alassio while she was staying in a hotel. The woman was treated at a hospital in Genoa.[70] Later in the day, a second case in Liguria was confirmed, a 54-year-old man who had visited Codogno for work and tested positive in La Spezia.[71][72][73] On 26 February, a 69-year-old man from Lodi with pre-existing medical conditions died in Emilia-Romagna.[74] The mayor of Borgonovo Val Tidone, Pietro Mazzocchi, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent a voluntary isolation at home.[75]
Additional cases involving six minors were identified in Lombardy. A 4-year-old girl from Castiglione d'Adda was admitted to Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia, and a 15-year-old was hospitalised in Seriate Hospital in Bergamo. Two 10-year-olds from Cremona and Lodi tested positive and were discharged. A 17-year-old from Valtellina who attended a school in Codogno, and a school friend from Sondrio, also tested positive.[32][74][76] Officials in Apulia confirmed that a 33-year-old man from Taranto, who returned from Codogno on 24 February, tested positive and was admitted to San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital.[77] A close advisor to Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although Fontana tested negative, he decided to put himself in preventive isolation as well.[78] Officials in Campania confirmed two new cases. A 24-year-old woman from Caserta, who had visited Milan, tested positive.

By 24 March, almost 7,000 people in the province of Bergamo had tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 1,000 people had died from the virus — making Bergamo the most hard-hit province in all of Italy during the pandemic.[88]
Veneto clusterA secondary cluster of infections occurred in the region of Veneto, initially thought to be the result of a farmer being infected when visiting the primary source in Codogno.[34] The farmer was tested, and the following day, the test was confirmed negative.[89]
On 21 February 2020, two people tested positive in Veneto. The next day, one of them, a 78-year-old man, died at the Schiavonia Hospital in Monselice, making him the first fatality in Italy. The man lived in the municipality of Vò, which was put under quarantine.[90]

The Ministry of Health announced new guidelines for reporting cases. It would no longer report asymptomatic cases (positive swabs taken from patients who were not showing symptoms), which had counted as 40 to 50% of all reported cases at the time. These people would undergo isolation at home and would be followed up with new tests until they were negative.[205][206] Universities in Lombardy extended their closure until 7 March.[71]
Nationwide measuresOn 1 March, the Council of Ministers approved a decree to organise the containment of the outbreak. In the decree, the Italian national territory was divided into three areas:[207]
A red zone (composed of the municipalities of Bertonico, Casalpusterlengo, Castelgerundo, Castiglione D'Adda, Codogno, Fombio, Maleo, San Fiorano, Somaglia and Terranova dei Passerini in Lombardy, and the municipality of Vò in Veneto), where the whole population is in quarantine.A yellow zone (composed of the regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna), where social and sport events are suspended and schools, theatres, clubs and cinemas are closed.The rest of the national territory, where safety and prevention measures are advertised in public places and special sanitisations are performed on means of public transport.On 4 March, the Italian government imposed the shutdown of all schools and universities nationwide for two weeks as the country reached 100 deaths from the outbreak.[208][209] The same day, the government ruled that all sporting events in Italy would be played behind closed doors until 3 April.[210]
On 5 March, when the newly appointed Emilia-Romagna regional minister of health, Raffale Donini, tested positive for COVID-19, Governor Stefano Bonaccini appointed Sergio Venturi as commissioner for the emergency. Venturi was the regional minister of health until February 2020.[211]
In the night between 7 and 8 March, the government approved a decree to lock down Lombardy and 14 other provinces in Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Marche, involving more than 16 million people.[212] The decree "absolutely avoided any movement into and out of the areas" and, like the previous one, it provided sanctions of up to three months in prison for those who violated the lockdown.[213] It was possible to move into and out of the areas only for emergencies or "proven working needs", which must be authorised by the prefect.[214] The decree also established the closure of all gyms, swimming pools, spas and wellness centres. Shopping centres had to be closed on weekends, while other commercial activities could remain open if a distance of one metre between customers could be guaranteed.[215] The decree imposed the closure of museums, cultural centres and ski resorts in the lockdown areas and the closure of cinemas, theatres, pubs, dance schools, game rooms, betting rooms and bingo halls, discos and similar places in the entire country.[216] Civil and religious ceremonies, including funeral ceremonies, were suspended. All organised events were also suspended, as well as events in public or private places, including those of a cultural, recreational, sporting and religious nature, even if held in closed places.[217] This measure was described as the largest lockdown in the history of Europe,[218][219] as well as the most aggressive response taken in any region beyond China, and paralysed the wealthiest parts of the country as Italy attempted to constrain the rapid spread of the disease.[220][221]
Riots broke out in many penitentiaries throughout Italy after restrictions on conjugal visits were imposed by the government in the 8 March decree.[222] Nine prisoners died in Modena and three in Rieti,[223][224] while 76 detainees escaped from Foggia's penitentiary.[225][226][227] Two prison agents were assaulted and kidnapped in Pavia.[228] On 9 March in Bologna, detainees took control of the Dozza penitentiary, forcing personnel to exit the building.[229] On 11 March, two prisoners were found dead in Bologna's penitentiary.[230]
On 9 March, the government announced that all sporting events in Italy would be cancelled until at least 3 April, but the ban does not include Italian clubs or national teams participating in international competitions.[231] In the evening, Conte announced in a press conference that all measures previously applied only in the so-called "red zones" had been extended to the whole country, putting approximately 60 million people in lockdown. Conte later proceeded to officially sign the new executive decree.[232][233]
On 11 March, the government allocated 25 billion euros for the emergency.[234] In the evening, Conte announced a tightening of the lockdown, with all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, like grocery shops and pharmacies, closed down.[12][11][235] He also appointed Domenico Arcuri as Delegated Commissioner for the Emergency. Arcuri will cooperate with Commissioner Angelo Borrelli with the aim of strengthening the distribution of intensive care equipment.[236]
On 19 March, the Army was deployed to the city of Bergamo, the worst hit Italian city by the coronavirus, as the local authorities can no longer process the number of dead residents. The city's mayor Giorgio Gori said the true number of dead could be much higher than reported.[237] Army trucks transported bodies to crematoriums in several other cities, as cemeteries in the city were full.[238] On the following day, the Army was called in to assist the police forces in enforcing the lockdown.[239]

Export restrictions and aid receivedThe Italian government asked for medical equipment from the European Union mechanism of civil protection, and on 11 March complained about the slow response of the other European countries.[316] The Italian Permanent Representative to the European Union, Maurizio Massari, wrote: "unfortunately, not a single EU country responded to the Commission’s call."[317][318]  Eventually, Germany, France and Austria donated millions of protective masks to Italy, however aid arrived from non-EU countries like China, Russia and Cuba before it arrived from any other EU country.[319][320][321]
The lack of masks became an issue during the peak of the emergency, partly because of the requisitions of imported goods bought by Italy in transport hubs in other countries such as Poland[322] and Turkey.[323][324] Masks were confiscated by mistake in Czechia. It was happen during a raid against Chinese reseller Zhou Lingjian.[325]
Since early March, the German government restricted the export of products essential to its national health service. Italian distributors were advised they could not be supplied with surgical gowns, protective masks, glasses, particulate respirators, nor visors.[326][327] France also imposed similar export restrictions and the German health minister Jens Spahn defended Germany's decision.[328] On 12 March, the German ministry issued a decree suspending the export restriction in particular emergency cases, and promised to send one million protective masks to Italy.[329]

ImpactHealthcareThe pandemic outbreak put pressure on the Italian healthcare system.[350]
Intensive care units were expanded, and new hospitals were created, especially in Lombardy.[351][352][353] In Emilia-Romagna, professor Marco Ranieri developed a method to double the usage of ventilators in ICUs.[354] The lack of a single protocol for hospitals was considered a problem.[355]
A letter published on the New England Journal of Medicine Catalyst Innovations in Care Delivery claimed that the reason for the elevated death count in the area of Bergamo was hospital contamination.[356] Progressively, different hospitals became dedicated to COVID-19 patients only, and more rigid separations were set up between hospital sections and triage structures.[357][358][359][360] In some regions, hotels were used to host healthcare workers[361] or patients,[362] and in Liguria a ship was adapted to host people in quarantine.[363] On 1 April, the first Italian drive-through testing facility opened in Alessandria.[364]
At least ten different clinical trials were ongoing in Italian hospitals at the beginning of April.[365] The supercomputer of ENEA in Portici was used to run advanced simulations related to other possible drugs.[366] Some of the treatments employed for COVID-19 patients involved the administration of antiviral drugs. Remdesivir was tested with promising initial results in Naples.[367] Despite doubts from the scientific community, Avigan (favipiravir) was also included in testing protocols by Italian Medicines Agency even though it was not authorized in Europe.[365][368][369] Similarly to France, hydroxychloroquine[365] (the less toxic version of the malaria drug chloroquine) was also tested.[370] Plasma treatment already tried in China (transfer of antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients to sick people) was tested at the hospital of Pavia (and later in Mantua) under the supervision of professor Cesare Perotti[371]; the first two donors involved in the research programme were a married couple, both doctors and among the first COVID-19 patients reported in the province.[372][373]
The workforce of the healthcare system underwent massive reorganization. Pediatricians were assigned to adult patients and as a result, their insurance coverage had to be adapted.[374] Retired professionals were asked to go back to work to fill the gaps, despite the high risk for their age group.[375][376][377]
Healthcare workers were also affected by coronavirus infections, with a higher percentage of the infected healthcare workers being women because of their predominance among nurses.[378] This caused death in a considerable amount of cases, especially general practitioners.[378][379][380] More than 60 doctors in Italy have died with COVID-19 by the end of March[381] and the figure increased to 80 by 4 April.[382] Healthcare personnel were also subject to high levels of stress[383] and the risk of professional burn-out was considered high, particularly across nurses and in more affected areas.[384] Two suicides, one of a nurse in Jesolo and one of a nurse in Monza, were assumed to be related to psychological pressure.[385][386]
The emergency was an occasion to test or develop new protocols based on digital technologies. With the aim of reducing consumption of protecitve equipments, robots were introduced in hospitals in Varese[387] and remote diagnostics were introduced to monitor home care patients in Lodi.[388] To facilitate home calls from patients, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genoa (IIT) and Istituto di robotica e macchine intelligenti (I-RIM) designed a robot for video calls that could be assembled by hospital personnel.[389][390] The Policlinico Universitario in Rome tested AI software for fast analysis of chest X-rays.[391]
EconomyThe pandemic provoked large economic damage to the Italian economy. The sectors of tourism, accommodation and food services were among the hardest hit by foreign countries' limitations to travel to Italy, and by the nationwide lockdown imposed by the government on 8 March.[392]
On 12 March, the Italian stock market was among the worst hit during Black Thursday, when the FTSE MIB index lost 17% of its value in one day.[393]
Multiple factories, like Fiat Chrysler, halted production in some of their plants.[394] On 21 March, the government issued the shutdown of all non-essential businesses, industries, and economic activities.[395]
Economist Alberto Bisin forecast that Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from 130% to 180% by the end of the year, due to borrowing and losses.[396]
Some Italian small and medium-sized enterprises partially or totally converted their production to supply personal protective equipment at a local scale. Many of these items could not be approved for hospital use, but they were considered useful to supply demand for the general population.[397]
In Veneto, Grafica Veneta – the printing company of the Harry Potter books in Italian – started to mass-produce protective masks.[398][399][400] 
In Piedmont, Ci.Ti.Elle, a company from Castiglione Torinese specialized in textiles for hotels, put its twelve employers to assemble surgical masks for the regional Protezione Civile, and the hospitals of San Maurizio Canavese, Alessandria and Chivasso, with the support the Filmar company from Caselle for the elastics.[401] 
In Lombardy Cifra, a manufacturer from Verano Brianza specialized in sportswear, also converted its production line.[402]
In the textile district of the province of Prato, the company Machattie started its production of polypropylene masks in March, and the company Dreoni in Vaiano switched its production from car upholstery to protective masks with certified standard, with the help of the local population.[397]
Companies producing alcoholic beverages also underwent reconversion to produce alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In Piedmont this occurred in Canelli at the Ramazzotti factory (part of the Pernod Ricard group)[403] and in Chieri at the Martini plant.[404]
Isinnova, a local engineering startup from Brescia, provided emergency solutions to local hospitals in order to compensate the shortages of spare parts for the machines. Firstly, they produced Venturi valves for respirators using 3D printers,[405][406] and later (in collaboration with Decathlon Group) they adapted a snorkelling mask into a non-invasive ventilator.[407] Using 3D-printer technology as well, Elmec Informatica also started to produce for the hospital of Busto Arsizio sterilizable protective masks in thermoplastic polyurethanes that could adapt to CPAP antiviral filters.[408]
On 25 March, Italy, together with Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain, sent a joint letter to the Council of the EU, calling for the issuing of a new common debt instrument, nicknamed in the media as "eurobond" or "corona bond", in order to help funding the measures taken against the coronavirus pandemic and the expected economic downturn to follow.[409] In subsequent conference calls between the leaders of the EU member states, the proposal saw the opposition of the Netherlands and Germany.[410][411]
SocietySubsequent to the imposing of the national lockdown, there were protests in some Italian prisons, with six deaths after clashes in the Sant'Anna penitentiary in Modena.[412]
With all of Italy ordered to remain indoors, Italians took to their balconies to sing together, play music, and applaud the country's health care providers.[413] Some of the demonstrations were spontaneous, others were organised by social media and radio.[414] On 13 March at 6 pm, Italians throughout the country joined to sing the national anthem. At noon on 14 March, they stood on their balconies clapping to salute the nation's health care workers.[415] A video of opera singer Maurizio Marchini performing the aria "Nessun dorma" from his balcony in Florence went viral.[416]
EducationAfter the first outbreak in Lombardy and Veneto, the regional governments of Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Trentino, and Veneto closed all schools and universities from 23 February to 1 March.[417][418] The suspension was later extended, with the agreement of the national government, up to 8 March in Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, and Veneto.[419]
On 4 March, the government announced the closure of all schools and colleges until 15 March.[420]
With the enactment of the lockdown of Lombardy and 14 more northern provinces on 8 March, the re-opening of schools in these areas was delayed to 3 April.[421] On 9 March, the government extended the lockdown to the national territory, closing all schools and universities until 3 April.[422]
ReligionIn Italy, in-person gatherings for religious worship have been suspended and as a result, many churches broadcast Mass via online live-stream, radio and television.[423]
Church funerals cannot be held given the national lockdown.[424] In some northern cities, authorities have had issues in dealing with the storage of the high number of coffins, and churches have offered to care for them.[424] In the towns of Seriate and Bergamo, the Italian Army has volunteered to transport some of these coffins from churches and morgues to cemeteries and crematoriums in other provinces.[424][425]
PoliticsOn 5 March, the Italian government decided to postpone the constitutional referendum that was due on 29 March. The referendum has been delayed until further notice.[426]
StatisticsDeaths statistics for Italy do not include the total amount of coronavirus victims who died outside hospitals, including dozens who died in different nursing homes across the country. Therefore, the official deaths statistics are considered an underestimate.[427]
