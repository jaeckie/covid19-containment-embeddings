By districts and towns[edit]Deaths[edit]Aid[edit]International aid[edit]The countries and international organizations that have sent aid and funds to Government of Serbia, to help fight the pandemic:
 People's Republic of China have first donated Serbia COVID-19 tests and sent medical staff, who have experience with combating the disease in Guangdong province.[66][67] Norway On 20 March, the Norwegian ambassador to Serbia Jern Eugen Jelstad, has informed the President of Serbia of 5 million euros of aid aimed at combating the pandemic.[68][69] Russia has donated Serbia 15,000 COVID-19 tests.[70] Russian Air Force has also flown 11 Il-76 planeholds of medical experts, large amount of medical equipment, technical and protective gear and 16 motor vehicles for disinfection of facilities and roads to Serbia to help it fight the coronavirus spread.[71] European Union have donated 7.5 million euros aimed at expanding the capacity and improving the capabilities of combating the coronavirus pandemic. On March 26th, the EU have financed the aid flight from China. Further 94 million euros have been aimed at combating the pandemic.[72][73][74]. On the same day Swedish diplomat and former Prime Minister Carl Bildt have made remarks on Vučić's stance on the European aid compared to the Chinese.[75] .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}When China sent an aircraft with help to Serbia President Vučić made a great show of it. But when far more substantial aid arrives there is no fanfare and no President in sight.— Carl Bildt, http://rs.n1info.com/Vesti/a582639/Bilt-Vucic-pravio-sou-za-avion-iz-Kine-a-kada-stigne-pomoc-od-EU-nema-ga-nigde.htmlWhen China sent an aircraft with help to Serbia President Vučić made a great show of it. But when far more substantial aid arrives there is no fanfare and no President in sight.Serbian PM Ana Brnabić accused Carl Bildt for spreading of fake news, because the medical aid was partially donated by China and partially bought by Serbia and the flight was paid by the EU.[76]
 United Arab Emirates have donated 10 tons of medical aid.[77]Personal donations[edit]Retired tennis player Ana Ivanović donated 35 ventilators and medical aid packages.[78]Football manager Dejan Stanković and his business partner Dragan Ruvarac donated ventilators and medical equipment.[79]World No. 1 tennis player Novak Đoković donated 1 million euros for ventilators and medical aid packages.[80]Controversies[edit]Seeing as Coronavirus spread throughout Europe, on February 26. president Aleksandar Vučić called for a press conference where he addressed the possibility of the virus impacting Serbia. This news conference made headlines the following days after a pulmonologist Dr. Branimir Nestorović made joking statements about the virus, calling it "the most laughable virus in the history of the mankind" and suggested that women should travel to then virus-affected Italy for shopping. The president, who was visible in the background expressing amusement and chuckling at this during the TV broadcast, later denied any accusations of portraying the virus as such by Dr Nestorović.[81][82]
I cannot believe that the same people, who survived sanctions, bombing, the day-to-day bullying of all kinds, can get scared by the most laughable virus in the history of mankind, which [only] exists on Facebook.I appeal to the people to stop trusting unproven information. The epidemic in China is at its end, it started on 7 December [2019] when the first case was reported. It is already known that virulence of the virus is in decline, hence the virus becomes more and more weak as the time passes by. But the virus is weak in any case. Here's something regarding women... The estrogen definitely  protects women, they have mild symptoms and they don't die from this virus. So, women, you can go shopping to Italy, I've heard that, now, there will be huge discounts there, because now nobody wants to go to Italy. So, prepare your husbands mentally for that. I am joking, but for real, I think, I don't understand. Couple of days ago I was shocked when that story (about the virus) started because the virus itself was laughable. This is the third variant of SARS and MERS, the corona viruses, this is the third variant and is the weakest of all three. The first two went unnoticed, and now, suddenly, this third one... I see now borders are being closed, planes don't fly... An absolute nonsense.In April 2020, a decree that limited access to public information about COVID-19 was announced, but after public reaction it was revoked. The declared goal of the decree was to limit the spread of fake news about the coronavirus in Serbia.[83]
