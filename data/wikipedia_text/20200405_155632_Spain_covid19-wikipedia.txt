On 9 March, the Spanish stock index IBEX-35 dropped 7.96%, the fourth-largest single-day loss in its history.[270] On 12 March, the stock index dropped another 14.06%, the largest in history, as part of the 2020 stock market crash.[271] The pandemic has also influenced Spain's fragile economy and finances, with economist Toni Roldán stating that the country will need €200bn in loans from the European Stability Mechanism.[243] Spanish leaders have called for "corona bonds", similar to the proposed but never implemented eurobonds, to help the country recover from the epidemic.[255][272] The number of employed people in Spain saw its largest historical drop in a month in March, with close to 900,000 people becoming jobless between 12 March and 31 March.[273] As of 28 March, Goldman Sachs was predicting a double-digit GDP decline for Spain.[274]
Low income neighborhoods in Barcelona have seven times the rate of infection of more affluent neighborhoods. Part of the reason is that essential workers, who have kept going to work despite the epidemic, are likely to work in low-skill jobs such as supermarkets or elder care. Also, many care workers are immigrants, who lack access to unemployment benefits and live in some of the lowest category housing. Homeless people are also at risk and the charities that help them were forced to cease operations because of the disease.[275]
On 28 March, children and young people who obeyed social distancing by staying at home were applauded by Spanish residents for doing their part to combat the epidemic.[276] By 29 March, visits to retail and recreation places, transit stations and parks had fallen by 94%, 88%, and 89% respectively, and visits to workplaces had reduced by 64%, according to a report by Google based on location history data from mobile devices.[277]
Healthcare system[edit]On 23 March, The Guardian reported that hospitals in the Madrid area were being overwhelmed by coronavirus patients.[278] Per capita, Spain has only a third as many hospital beds as Germany and Austria.[243] As of 28 March, the burden on intensive care units per confirmed case was 7.8, almost as high as Italy and far above any other European country.[279] As of 31 March, intensive care units in Cataluña, Madrid, Castilla–La Mancha, and Castilla y León are at or over 80% capacity, despite efforts to triple the number of beds available. Most of the patients are suffering from coronavirus.[280] However, El País reported that the number of patients in intensive care was decreasing and fewer patients were coming to the hospital with medical emergencies, especially in Madrid. According to Miquel Porta, this is an indication that government containment measures are having an effect.[281] Austerity measures, enacted by the previous government of Mariano Rajoy which cut billions of euros from health budgetss, were blamed by some experts for reducing the capacity of the healthcare system. Healthcare spending in Spain is 5.9 percent, below the EU average of 7.5 percent. Before the coronavirus epidemic, some doctors were unemployed or had emigrated to look for work. Now, retired healthcare workers are being called back to the job and medical students are being recruited to perform some tasks. The privatization of hospitals undergone during Rajoy's regime has undermined efforts to coordinate the response to the crisis.[275][282]
As of 28 March, at least 9,444 of the cases—about 14% of the total, double that of Italy—are in healthcare workers. One cause of infection is the lack of adequate protective gear, leading some healthcare workers to make their own improvised gear. According to Fernando Simón, only 8.8% of diagnosed healthcare workers require hospitalization, in contrast to 40% of other cases of the disease. Some doctors and nurses have nevertheless succumbed to the illness.[283][279]
Many nursing homes in Spain are understaffed because they are for-profit businesses and elderly Spaniards cannot necessarily afford sufficient care.[243] In some nursing homes, elderly victims were found abandoned in their beds by Spanish soldiers mounting emergency response. Defense minister Margarita Robles said that anyone guilty of neglect will be prosecuted.[278] By 23 March, a fifth of nursing homes in the Madrid area had reported cases of the virus. More than 65% of fatalities have occurred in those 80 or older, compared to 50% in Italy and only 15% in China.[284] By 3 April, at least 3,500 Spaniards had died in nursing homes and another 6,500 contracted infections there. Thousands of elder care workers are also infected.[285]
Political impact[edit]On 8 March 2020, Vox held a political rally that was attended by over 9,000 people and later apologised after Santiago Abascal, its president, Javier Ortega Smith, its secretary general, and multiple members of its party in the Congress of Deputies tested positive for COVID-19.[286]
On 12 March 2020, the Congress of Deputies voted to suspend activity for a week after multiple members had tested positive for the virus.[286] When the Congress of Deputies approved the extension of the State of Alarm on 18 March, it was the first time that opposition parties The People's Party and Vox had supported the government in a vote while separatist parties, such as Catalan Republican Left, abstained.[287]
The response to the coronavirus has been complicated by the fact that Pedro Sánchez is leading PSOE (in coalition with Unidas Podemos) minority government which is counting on support from opposition parties to enact coronavirus measures, especially with regards to economic stimulus. So far, the cabinet has discussed proposals to offer zero-interest loans to tenants to pay rent so that smaller landlords who depend on rent income can stay afloat. PP leader Pablo Casado complained that the government was not keeping him informed of developments on the coronavirus. Citizens leader Inés Arrimadas said that she supports the government's actions.[287] Vox has called for the prime minister's resignation.[256]
The 2020 Basque regional election, scheduled for 5 April, was delayed, after an agreement between all the political parties represented in the Basque parliament; the Galician election was also suspended.[288][289]

Days later she felt discomfort and fever, so she was hospitalised and underwent various tests. The person, 70 years old and with previous illnesses, was isolated and admitted “in intensive care”. According to Deputy Minister Julio López, her status was critical and her forecast was reserved.[290] On 13 March 2020, the first death (the first Ecuadorian infection case) was reported by the Minister of Public Health of Ecuador, Catalina Andramuño, during a press conference in Guayaquil.[291]

Statistics[edit]Ministry of Health statistics are provided at 11:30 each day for the previous 24 hours, but are inaccurate and incomplete. The number of infected is considered to be higher than the confirmed tally due to lack of testing; only those with severe symptoms are offered tests and this likely lags symptom onset by as much as a week. The total number of infected could be ten times higher than confirmed cases, or even more than that. Deaths are also underestimated, because some people are not tested before they die due to health system failure and many elderly people are dying at home or in nursing homes without being diagnosed with the virus.[387] A report by Carlos III Health Institute found significant excess mortality that was not captured in official coronavirus death statistics.[387][388] Some communities had only been able to identify half of their coronavirus deaths while others had managed to eliminate this problem after 16 March.[20] Therefore, the number of deaths attributable to the virus may be thousands above the confirmed figure.[387]
