Prevention measures[edit]On 25 February, Skender Brataj, head of the National Medical Emergency Center (NMEC), announced protocols in case COVID-19 spread to Albania, explaining that citizens that suspect they have contracted the virus should call the designated National Emergency Number 127.[24] He instructed all Albanian citizens arriving from China, Singapore, Iran, South Korea or Italy, to call the same number, so that a medical group with protective suits can escort them to an infections hospital for testing, with all samples sent to the Public Health Institute.[24] On the same day, the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection met with the Technical Expert Committee, and decided to increase its hospital budget by $1 million, to increase the stock of personal protection equipment.[24] Brataj also announced the formation of a task force, while asserting that COVID-19 had not yet arrived in Albania. He specified that citizens coming from affected areas would be monitored for 14 days and treated as suspected cases, and treated with vitamins.[24]
After the arrival of COVID-19[edit]On 8 March, the Albanian government stopped all flights and ferries with quarantined areas of northern Italy until 3 April,[25] halted all schools for two weeks, ordered cancellation of all large public gatherings, and asked sports federations to cancel scheduled matches.[26] Albanian Health Minister Olgeta Manastirliu announced that anyone entering Albania from quarantined areas of Italy will have to self-isolate, or face punishment if they fail to do so.[26]
Beginning of lockdown[edit]On 10 March, all citizens were alerted of the new lockdown policy by text from Prime Minister Edi Rama, who said the policy was regrettable but necessary, with the text also telling them to be safe, wash their hands and avoid fake news, while also announcing a vehicle ban.[27] Use of private cars and intercity transport vehicles was banned in Tirana and Durrës, and all private and public transport was banned in Shkodra, Lezha, Elbasani, Lushnja, Fieri and Vlora, with the only vehicles allowed being ambulances and vehicles for delivering essentials.[27] Bonuses of 1000 euros were added to the salaries of medical staff, and a 500 euro bonus was added to the salary of medical workers.[27] The disinfection of all public places was also underway.[27] The retired would get their pensions delivered at home with no charge.[27] Bars, restaurants, gyms, discos, and venues with live music were all ordered to close.[27]
Rama also announced an expansion of the areas from which arrivals must self-isolate, to newly include all of Italy as well as all of Greece, and ordered police to patrol the streets, detain any violators, and penalize them with a 5000 euro fine.[27][28] The army and police mobilized to patrol the streets and search for any citizens with self-isolation orders who could be violating them.[27]
Gjergj Erebara at Balkan Insight noted that much of the Albanian medical staff had emigrated to Germany in the previous few years, leaving Albanian hospitals with an acute shortage, having already had a rather low rate of doctors per inhabitant.[29]
On the night of 11 March, police vehicles played messages on loudspeakers telling citizens to return inside.[30] The Muslim community announced on 11 March that all sermons, prayers and other activities, including jummahs, and mosques were canceled, and told all believers to quarantine themselves and observe prayers at home in private, and rigorously follow and observe the recommendations of the World Health Organization.[31] By 12 March, 500 people had been charged for violating the travel ban.[27]
"War" against COVID-19[edit]On 12 March, Prime Minister Edi Rama declared a "war" on COVID-19.[32] A slew of new measures were announced, including a 72-hour curfew during which only transportation of basic needs such as food and medicine would be permitted, a three-month loan holiday, and the forced closure of garment factories and call centres (which are dependent on the Italian market).[32] The police and the army mobilized and set up a total of 70 checkpoints on that day, spread throughout the country to make sure people are complying with self-quarantine requirements. At checkpoints, names are checked against a database of who has been in Italy or Greece since 27 February. Police in some parts of the country, including Fier, began stopping cars with foreign license plates. Fier proceeded to force the closure of most bars and cafes, while Tirana and Durrës suspended indefinitely all public transport and shut all cafes, bars, restaurants, as well as gyms and government offices with public-facing counters.[30] All banks were closed from the 12 to 16 March, but ATMs remained open.[33]
The Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church announced on 12 March the suspension of all services until 3 April, except for the Divine Liturgy on Sunday, in which it encouraged followers to come for "healing" but keep a distance from each other; the Church also encouraged believers to observe rites at home, with the Church's radio station "Ngjallja" ("Resurrection") broadcasting services, although churches would remain to serve those who wished to perform personal prayer while keeping a distance from others.[34] The Catholic church suspended all diocesan and parish activities, all liturgical celebrations including the Holy Mass, all catechisms, all educational courses at community centers and all other parish and diocesan activities. Churches remained open for personal confessions done at a distance, as well as personal prayer  done at a distance from other people, while observing the recommendations of authorities.[35] The Albanian Evangelical Church likewise transmitted services online.[35] The Bektashi Global Kryegjyshata suspended all religious activities in its tekkes on 12 March as well.[36]
From 13 March, Albania implemented a hardening of its lockdown in major cities across the country, including the capital, Tirana, over the weekend until 15 March at midnight. Roads connecting major cities were also closed. Foreign nationals that need to go to the airport needed to have received written permission from the police to use the roads. All public facilities at the airport were closed, including restaurants and bars.[37] Sea travel from Greece and Italy was prohibited except for freight vessels.[38]
On 15 March, Albania closed all of its land borders until further notice, making all travel from Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and Greece prohibited.[38] Educational institutions were ordered to prepare to move k-12 instructions online.[33] All physical government operations except essential activities were shut down, and civil servants ordered to stay down, but online services continued. All museums, cinemas, theatres, and public parks were closed indefinitely.[33] The Albanian government began organizing a charter flight to extract remaining Albanian citizens in Italy; all air travel to Italy and Greece was indefinitely suspended.[33] As of 15 March, in addition to the private vehicle ban, the public transportation ban was extended to the Shkodër-Lezhë, Elbasani-Korçë, Lushnjë-Fieri, and Fieri-Vlorë roads.[33]
On 16 March, Albania indefinitely suspended all air traffic to and from the United Kingdom.[39]
On 16 March, another wide-ranging "emergency legislation" was adopted, specifying various fines for violations of protocol, to be effective immediately. Social, cultural, and political gatherings, whether in enclosed or open-air spaces, were banned, and violators could be fined up to 5 million lek (or 40,000 euros). Television stations were banned from having more than two people in the same room for a talk show, on the pain of a 1 million lek fine (8300 euros). Private hospitals that refuse to offer capacities were to be fined up to 5 million lek (40000 euros). Any trade in food or medicine that did not comply with the specified government safety regulations to combat infections risked a fine of up to 10 million lek (83000 euros). The legislation, called a "normative act", is an emergency law taking effect without prior approval by parliament.[40] Furthermore, a national curfew was imposed: each day, all citizens were required to return to stay in their homes from 18:00 onward, as well as a ban on sitting in public places. Those found in violation will be fined.[41] On 18 March, the Tirana Times suspended its print version.[42]
The handling of the coronavirus pandemic risk to refugees has been criticized as inadequate. Two detention centers exist in Albania. Their conditions have been reported as having very poor conditions that increase the danger of exposure to the pandemic.[43]
On 29 March, Albania sent a group of thirty medical staff members to Lombardy, Italy.
Prime Minister Edi Rama said his country was thanking former Italian help.[44]
